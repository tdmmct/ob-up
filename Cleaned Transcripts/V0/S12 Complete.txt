The best home bakers from across the
country applied in their thousands.

Just 12 have made it...

Oh, blimey. Here we go.

Good luck, everyone!



..to our Bake Off bubble.

When you're telling people
that you're going away,

absolutely nobody's guessed where I'm going.

I mean, what's wrong with my cakes?

I wasn't gonna apply for Bake Off

and my sister was like,
"Just apply."

I was like, "Why did you tell me
to apply? Because I got through."

When we look in the tent,
it's the feeling you get

when you walk for the first
time into the... the Sistine Chapel.

Every aspect of their
baking skills will be tested...

On your marks... in 30...

Get set.
..brand-new challenges.

Bake! We're on the way.
Good luck in there.

My German brain gets active
when I make sweet stuff.



♪ More chocolate! ♪

I just enjoy feeding people
because that's what Greek people do.

Everything they create will be
judged by Prue Leith...

Don't wanna get emotional.
That's so delicious!

..and Paul Hollywood.
Don't look into his eyes.

I'm gonna stare him down.
Don't stare Paul down.

No.

We begin with incredible cakes.

Oh, my God! That's going in my eye.
Come on!

With a delicious childhood
favourite...

Cos they're mini,
you've got to get it really tight.

That's panicked me.

..one of the all-time
tea-time classics...

It doesn't wanna come off.
This is a joke!

It's very gooey. Ooh!

..and mind-bending showstoppers...

I feel sick.
..that defy the laws of gravity.

To me, to you. To you.
The cake is on the move, people.

To me. To you.
I'm so scared it's gonna fall.

It's Dessert Week, and the bakers put their twist on the classic pavlova, take on a toffee technical, and create a delicate dessert wrapped in intricately patterned sponge for the showstopper.
Hello, comedian and artist Noel Fielding.

Are you excited for Dessert Week?

Not especially.
I've never even had a dessert before.

Eh? How come?

I can't eat. Tragically,
I was born without a mouth.

-Really?
-Yeah. It's very sad.

Well, what are you talking out of now?

This is my butt.

Well, that explains a lot.

[both] Welcome to
The Great British Baking Show.

[mimics passing wind] Sorry.



-[Matt] Ugh.
-Matthew.

Don't be like that. Matthew!

[Matt] No, you've let us both down.

-You wrote this.
-[Matt] Yeah, well, you said it.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

-[Noel] Nowâ¦
-[both exclaim]

â¦the bakers indulge in Dessert Weekâ¦

[both] Mmm!

â¦with a cracking Signatureâ¦

Come on, man. Don't do this to me.

â¦and tricky toffee Technical.

Mash it up!

[Noel] But they must save room for
a spectacular, multilayered Showstopperâ¦

Everybody's terrified
about collapsing cakes.



â¦which will leave the bakersâ¦

[Maggie] This is gonna go splodge.

â¦ready to burst.

Whoopsie-daisies.

[opening theme playing]

[Amanda] It's Dessert Week!

So excited.

Who wouldn't be?

[Chigs] First thing I look at
in a restaurant is the dessert menu.

I got proper sweetâ¦

I've got sweet teeth,
not a sweet tooth. [chuckles]

I am really nervous of a vegan
substitute for this week.

Definitely not as easy to use.

People were like,
"Why don't you just bail out?"

I was like,
"No, stick by your morals." [chuckles]

My friends will probably say,
"What does Maggie know about desserts?"

"She never eats them."

The truth of that
will be in the eating later on.

Good morning, bakers, and welcome back
to the tent for Dessert Week.

For your Signature challenge,
the judges would love you

to make a beautifully decorated pavlova.

[Matt] Your pavlova
can be any flavour you like,

but it should be perfectly baked
with a crisp outer shell

and have a soft, pillowy centre.

[both] Mmm!

You have two hours and 45 minutes.

-On your marks.
-Get set.

Bake!

[Lizzie] I don't really eat pavlovas.

Sticky toffee pudding I'm about.

You've got to feel
like you've ate something.

Egg whites, innit, and sugar? [laughs]

What can go wrong?

[Paul] What we're looking for
in a pavlova is a crispy exterior

and a little chewy
marshmallow texture inside,

filled with whatever they wish.

To get the texture right,
you need to bake it for an hour,

turn the oven off and leave it cooling
for as long as possible.

The hard part of this is getting
the bake right in the meringue.

They could crack, they could bead, melt,

allow water to come out
or, indeed, collapse.

The middle is always the most difficult.

The bottom needs to be firm enough
to support the fillings

without becoming squishy.

It's a pretty tricky challenge.

There's 101 different reasons
why meringues will fail.

And to do it in two hours 45
makes it even harder.

-Hi, Giuseppe.
-[Giuseppe] Good morning.

Tell us about your pavlova.

It's called "Every Day at the Beach,"
inspired by one of my childhood memories.

So it's going to be peaches and coconut.

Peaches, what my mum used to bring

and coconut is what this guy
used to sell and still does nowadays

shouting, "coco bello"
around the beach every day.

-So delicious.
-I liked everything you said. [chuckles]

[Matt] To bring those hazy days
on the beach to life,

reigning Star Baker Giuseppe
will make a coconut Chantilly cream,

peach crÃ©meux and coulis
encased in a piped French meringue.

It's a basic meringue.

I had problems in the past. I was baking
it at too high temperature and it cracked.

So I'm going at 120 degrees
for 75 minutes first

and then at least half an hour
with the oven off.

-[Paul] Good luck. Thank you.
-Thank you.

-Cheers.
-Have a good one.

[Matt] While Giuseppe's celebrating
peachy times with Mama,

it's extended family on Crystelle's mind.

[Crystelle] My godmother Pamela,

we call her "Pamlova"
because she is amazing at pavlovas

and brings one to every family event.

But she didn't give me
the recipe. [laughs]

I'm still doing this in honour of her
even though I do slightly resent her.

[laughs]

[Noel] Pamela's secret might be safe,
but Crystelle has a plan

involving coconut crumble,
lime curd and kiwi slices

to create a twist on a dessert classic

and a favourite of a certain
steely-eyed judge.

Paul Hollywood loves key lime pie.

-Now I'm so panicked.
-[Matt] Why?

He's going to eat it and be like,
"This isn't a key lime pie."

I just find key lime,

the key is always a bit metallic.

-I'm a walking dad joke.
-[laughs]

[George] This is just a basic meringue.

So, it's just about whipping
the eggs and sugar together.

[Noel] Producing stable,
perfectly pillowy meringue

is a delicate, time-consuming process.

I'm adding in caster sugar
just one tablespoon at a time.

If you add lots, you then deflate
all the air you're trying to build up.

[Matt] While some are enhancing
their meringues with flavoursâ¦

[Freya] Half a teaspoon
of orange blossom extract.

â¦and coloursâ¦

I'm putting in some food colouring to mine
so it's a purple pavlova.

â¦Maggie's going back to basics.

[Maggie] I'm making
quite a simple meringue.

There's nothing fancy at all.

But the problem with doing it like that
is the meringue has to be really good.

[Matt] Her classic meringue,
coupled with raspberry syrup,

passion fruit cream
and a medley of frozen fruits,

will be as traditional as it comes.

-So, pretty classic. Yeah.
-Very classic. Yes.

I feel there's no real need
to enhance things.

[laughing] It's that look.

-[Paul] Well, good luck.
-[laughs]

Well, that was fun, wasn't it?

[both laugh]

Just making sure
the sugar's all dissolved.

It's ready. It's very stiff
and it's very glossy.

[Amanda] I'm gonna start shaping it.

My pavlova's called "Pav-love"

because I have a lovely,
heart-shaped chopping board.

It looks nice on there.

If it doesn't collapse.

[Matt] Assuming her heart
is up to the job,

Amanda will fill it
with a rich chocolate mascarpone

offset with a tangy raspberry curd.

[Amanda] It's looking
quite stiff, isn't it?

And hopefully it will keep its shape.

Otherwise, it won't be a heart,
it will just be a splodge.

[Noel] Whether shaped by handâ¦

I mean, this is meant to be a circle.

â¦or pipedâ¦

[Crystelle] I'm not going
for a very tall pavlova.

I'm going for a fancy flat one.

â¦the bakers must mould
their sticky meringueâ¦

Gonna attempt to kind of do
some sort of pattern. We'll see.

â¦into fabulous forms.

[Giuseppe] I've gone for
a bit of a crown shape.

[Noel] But for vegan Freyaâ¦

[Freya] She's getting there.

â¦it's even more of a challenge.

This is using aquafaba
instead of the egg whites.

It's a bit less stable.

It doesn't hold at all.

That's going to be good
for this competition.

Yeah, that's going to be great,
in this heat as well, yeah.

-This is a solid start.
-Yikes.

[Matt] While Freya's hoping
her meringue stands up,

she's adding orange blossom to make
her peach Melba flavours stand out.

[Freya] I'm gonna caramelise these peaches

and they go all, like, toasted and golden.

So, at least if the pavlova collapses,
at least we'll have some nice peaches.

Piping skills are ridiculous.

-Ah, thank you.
-[Prue] You really know what you're doing.

-Thank you, Freya. Good luck.
-[Freya] Thank you so much.

She's going in.

[Matt] When it comes to pavlovaâ¦

Going in.

â¦oven time is literally make-or-break.

The secret to this
is to go slow and steady

at a much lower temperature
and a much longer bake.

[Matt] Underbake and the inside will
end up sloppy or, worse still, collapse.

Be good to me.

[Matt] Overbake and the outside
could crack or break off completely.

[Amanda] Right, I'm going to bake it
on 140 for 25 minutes,

and then I'm going to turn it down to 120,
leave it for about another 35 minutes.

[sighs]

Good luck, pav.

Dear sir, I'll wager a shepherd's guinea
that the good gentlemen of this tent

are halfway through
completion of the challenge.

What about the ladies?

Ladies must never appear in the kitchen

for fear of coarsening
their delicate fingers.

Exactly.

I'll just start on the fillings now.

[Noel] The bakers must now perfect
fillings that elevate sugary meringuesâ¦

[Crystelle] There are
15 nutritious pavlova.

â¦to beautifully balanced pavlovas.

[Chigs] Uglier they look, riper they are,
my gran used to tell me.

It needs to be a nice contrast
to the sweet meringue.

It should be a party on your tongue.

[Matt] Guests at Chigs' tongue party

include a Chantilly cream,
chocolate shards,

fresh mango, passion fruit,
and a blast of tropical mango coulis.

-[Noel] How's it going?
-[Chigs] Another day in the office.

-And you're enjoying it?
-Yeah. Loving it.

-You're just getting better and better.
-I think I'm just starting. Starting.

I know. You're like Luke Skywalker.

-Yeah.
-And I feel like Paul's Obi-Wan.

-[Chigs chuckles]
-He knows the Force is strong in you.

Does that make you Yoda?

-I'm Yoda, yeah. Thanks.
-[laughs]

-I'm probably Chewbacca.
-[both laugh]

Bakers, you have one hour left!

Sorry about that.

Two tiny cracks,
which I am not fussed about.

As long as they're not Grand Canyons,
you'll be all right.

[Giuseppe] I'm turning the oven off
and let it go for another half an hour.

I'll leave the pavlova in there
to cool down.

[Matt] Take their meringues out
before they're coldâ¦

So, I think I'm just gonna
pop this open now.

â¦and all their hard work
could be for nothing.

[Crystelle] If this warm pavlova
hits cold air,

the inside basically shrinks,
and then your meringue cracks.

So, this, in theory, should
gradually bring down the temperature

so you don't get that shock.

[Noel] But with just one oven
and two bakes to completeâ¦

[George] I need that oven
to bake biscuits.

â¦it's a risk George is willing to take.

I'm gonna transfer my meringue
over to my proving drawer

without dropping it. [exhales]

Hope it's worth it.
All right, these are going in, 12 minutes.

[Noel] As well as spiced
speculoos biscuits

to counterbalance
the sweetness of his meringue,

he's also incorporating
a potent citrus flavour.

I'm just starting my lemon curd now.

I love raw lemon, lemon on everything,
like lemon overload.

I'm going for it.

[Noel] Like George, JÃ¼rgen's recipe
also requires some extra baking.

[JÃ¼rgen] For decoration,
I'm using matza, unleavened bread.

My wife is Jewish,

and we started to celebrate
the Jewish festivals along the year.

So, I'm making a pavlova
inspired by the flavours of Passover.

[Noel] As well as matza shards
coated in chocolate,

JÃ¼rgen's pavlova will feature vanilla
cream and a symbolic charoset paste.

[Prue] So, what's in there?

It's dates, it's a whole orange
with pith and peel,

a bit of cinnamon, bit of cardamom.

Dates are gonna be interesting in this.

Dates are so sweet
and meringue is very sweet.

It's the mortar used by the juice

to stick the pyramids
and the Pharaoh's cities together.

It's carrying a lot, this little pavlova.

-It is. It is.
-[Paul chuckles]

-You're an artist, JÃ¼rgen.
-[JÃ¼rgen] Thank you.

[Matt] A religious holiday
has also inspired Lizzie's pavlova.

-[Lizzie] It's an Easter pavlova.
-[Matt] What are the ingredients?

So, when you think Easter,
you think of baby lambs.

You put rosemary on lambs.

So, yeah, that's how I came up with it.

-So, will it taste of lamb?
-That's a bit too far, isn't it?

[Matt] With a purple blueberry meringue,

lemon curd and a bright green
rosemary crÃ¨me diplomat,

her Easter pavlova
doesn't pull any punches.

As long as the rosemary
isn't too powerful.

Yeah, it is quite subtle.

[Noel] I love the way you say "subtle"

given what you're wearing
and your hair today.

-[Noel and Prue laugh]
-I'm so under the radar.

It's unbelievable.

Bakers, you have half an hour left.

[Crystelle] I think I might take it out.

There's a bit of crackage,
a bit of weeping.

That's the side to look at.
Ignore that side.

[gasps] Maggie's got hers out.

-Oh, has everyone got theirs out?
-Don't follow the pressure.

[hyperventilating]

Here we are. It's cracked around the top,
but I expected that.

[Chigs] That's nice and high.

[Amanda] It's still a heart shape.

[George] I'm going to try
and take it out of the proving drawer.

[Matt] But for George,
his proving drawer techniqueâ¦

[George] It's cracked a lot more
than what I would've liked.

â¦hasn't proved to be a success.

But I'm gonna try and disguise it.

I've been criticised for my presentation
over the last few weeks,

so I want to try and have
something nice to present.

-[gasps] Oh, my God, that looks beautiful.
-[Freya] It looks good.

It's when you try and move it,
'cause it's gonna crack a little bit.

Gonna have to be very careful.

Very slow and delicate.

-[Freya] I just daren't do it.
-I just need to do it confidently.

No messing about.

Cracking on now.

Come on, man, don't do this to me.

[Crystelle] I'm trying to find a bit
that doesn't look fragile.

[Chigs] Slowly.

-Got it?
-Yeah.

So far, so good.

[George] Oh, don't put
your fat finger in it.

It's very collapse-y.

Oh, my God, it's moving,
it's moving, it's moving.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

[exhales heavily]

Bakers, you have ten minutes left!

If you're lucky.

Right, I need to get a move on.
I really need to get a move on.

[JÃ¼rgen] I'm going to cook
the matza for five minutes.

[Amanda] I've gotta get it decorated.

[Maggie] I made
some little meringue kisses.

It's not meant to be a candle. [laughs]

I'm putting charoset on.

[George] These are spice biscuits.

I'll blitz them up, whip up some cream,

fold it in and then pipe.

[Amanda] This is my chocolate mascarpone.

Raspberry coulis.

Hopefully it don't make it all mushy.

[George] I think Paul and Prue might have
something to say about this presentation.

Always going on about presentation,
aren't they?

I'd love it if one day you just wentâ¦

-Yeah.
-[both laugh]

And then walked out like that,
"See you later, guys."

[Lizzie] I think the colour's lovely,
I don't know if it's appetising.

Looks like some swamp creature.

Bakers, you have one minute left.

Ah!

[Chigs] Come on. Nearly there.

I'm just painting my matza.

[Maggie] I'm putting frozen fruit on top.
Hopefully, it won't leak out.

This here is the mango
and the blueberries.

[Freya] That's cute.

[gasps] Kiwis flying everywhere.

Bakers, your time is up.

Oh, that's it.

[Noel] Please step away
from your pavlovas.

Actually, I believe
the plural is "pavlovi."

-[Matt] Happy?
-Yeah, chuffed to bits.

It sunk and there's some cracks.
It's a pavlova.

[Noel] Nine Signature pavlovas
baked in just two hours 45 minutes

now face the judgment of Paul and Prue.

-[Prue] Hi, Crystelle.
-Hello.

-Hi.
-Hi, Crystelle.

-[Paul] Looks great.
-Those little egg shapes are lovely.

So, I've got a coconut streusel base,
a lime curd, and then fresh Kiwis.

[Prue] Delicious.

Really strong lime
which goes beautifully with the meringue.

The sides are too thick.

You've got, like, an impenetrable wall
you've gotta get through.

-But flavours are great though.
-[sighs] I'll take that.

We have the pyramids in matza.

-So, just the basic pavlova, then.
-[JÃ¼rgen] Just the basic pavlova.

[Paul] The idea is very good.
It's a little untidy. It's cracked a bit.

[Prue] That is so unusual.

You get the dates first
and then the orange.

It's a great blend of flavours,
and it works in that pavlova.

I would have thought it wouldn't have
enough acidity, but it does.

JÃ¼rgen's back.

-Thank you.
-[Prue laughs]

Mazel tov.

[laughing] Thank you.

[Paul] I mean, it's not the most
attractive looking pavlova.

-'Cause that green isâ¦ [laughs]
-[Prue] It looksâ¦

[Lizzie] It is blueberry, rosemary,
and lemon curd.

It's like something
out of a Willy Wonka Factory.

[Matt] Yeah.

I like the rosemary. Very good lemon curd.

The flavours are spot-on.
I just think it's a bit stodgy.

Love the appearance.
Has cracked a little bit.

I would have put more raspberry,
less chocolate.

-[Prue] The chocolate is so dominant.
-Okay.

-[Prue] George, I think it looks awful.
-Okay.

[Paul] The baking hasn't worked either.

That idea of putting it in the proving
drawer to get that sort of crack in there.

It's all marshmallow, isn't it?
You need to hollow it out more.

-The flavours are great.
-[George] Okay.

-The speculoos with the lemon.
-Absolutely delicious.

It's not all bad news. Thank you.

-I think "informal" is a good word to use.
-Exactly.

[Prue] Higgledy-piggledy.

[Paul] Structurally, it's lost its way.

-It's collapsed a little bit on the side.
-[Maggie] Yes.

The flavours are lovely.
I think it does look a bit of a mess.

It looks really summery and delicious.

[Paul] I think you could've baked it
a little bit longer.

-Because of that.
-[Giuseppe] Yes.

[Paul] It's broken away.

Mmm. Flavours are so fresh and summery.

The peachy cream is just delicious.

-Yeah. Thank you.
-[Prue] Well done.

-[Prue] Looks fantastic.
-Decoration looks very good.

-Butâ¦
-Oh, gosh.

The proof is literally in the pudding.

[Paul] Wow, it's like an Eton mess.

The aquafaba doesn't hold up well at all.

[Paul] They're not very strong flavours.

-They're not tangy or tart enough.
-[Freya] Okay.

If you get a slice
of the candied peach, it's good.

But the, sort of, sloppy bit
in the middle, that's not very nice.

-[Paul] That looks amazing.
-[Prue] I love the edge.

Just so casually, but elegantly swirled.

Beautiful. All right, let's have a look.

That just falls through.

-Are you excited?
-I am.

-That's for you.
-[Prue] Oh, look at that.

It's filled with Chantilly cream
and a mango and passion fruit coulis.

[Prue] It's lovely, soft,
but stable in the middle.

And crunchy outside.

I think it's wonderful.

The acidity and the cream is just lovely.

[Paul] There's a nice marshmallow
in there, its stable enough to hold it.

It's quite difficult to get that balance.

But the way you've done the top
and the chocolate, I can't, you knowâ¦

-[laughing]
-[Lizzie] Wow.

-[Paul] Well done.
-[Chigs] Thank you both. Thank you.

[Matt] Whoo!

-[exclaims]
-[Matt] Wow.

-Were you expecting that?
-No, no, not at all.

[Chigs] I can't believe it.
Hollywood handshake.

My work here is done now. [chuckles]

Paul said, "JÃ¼rgen is back,"
so I take that comment.

It's great.

I need to do well
in Technicals, definitely.

Going to go in with a positive attitude
and do my best.

All still to play for in Dessert Week.

[Noel] The bakers
could practice their pavlovas,

but their next challenge
is a complete mystery.

Bakers, welcome back to the tent
for your Technical challenge,

which, today, has been set
by the evil Prue-Ella De Vil.

This recipe requires
some serious multitasking,

so get organised.

[grunts] Shivers up my spine.

As ever, this task is judged blind,
so we ask the judges to leave the tent.

For your Technical challenge,
Evil Prue would like you each to make

four individual sticky toffee puddings.

Your sticky toffee puddings
need to be perfectly baked

and served with sticky toffee sauce.

-Would've thought that was obvious.
-You would've thought so.

Your sticky toffee pudding
should be decorated with tuile triangles

and served alongside
a smooth crÃ¨me anglaise.

[both] Mmmâ¦

[Matt] You have 90 minutes.

-[Noel] On your marksâ¦
-Get setâ¦

-Bake!
-[Crystelle sighs]

[chuckling] Why?

[exhales heavily]

I love sticky toffee pudding.
It's great, isn't it?

[Amanda] My husband makes
the sticky toffee pudding at home.

That's his thing.

So I never have to make it.
Now I wish I had.

I've never, ever made one. [chuckles]

We'll see how it goes.

This may beâ¦ I never have before,
maybe never, ever again.

-[Paul] So, sticky toffee pudding.
-Who doesn't like a sticky toffee pudding?

It's quite a complicated challenge.

They have to make the pudding,
they have to make caramel sauce,

the crÃ¨me anglaise
and they have to make tuile.

Of course, the sponge
is the most important thing.

The problem might be that they'll think
it's cooked when it's not.

So the danger is slightly undercooking.

Mmm, that is a lovely light sponge.

You can see it's baked all the way through
with that beautiful caramel on the top.

CrÃ¨me anglaise is beautifully smooth,
and it's that blend between the two.

The whole lot is lovely together.

I'm sure a couple of 'em
will get it spot-on.

I don't think we'll have any disasters.

This recipe
seems quite brief and complicated.

[Chigs] I'll make the tuile first,
which I've never done before.

I think it's a really thin,
skinny biscuit.

"Tuile"? Tuile? Tules?

"Cook the butter,
lemon juice and liquid glucoseâ¦"

"Remove from the heat
and stir in the dry ingredientsâ¦"

[George] Right. Hazelnuts,
sesame seeds, flour, butterâ¦

Is this right?

Okay.

I've got to let it rest.
I am now onâ¦ Make toffee sauce.

The sauce is the best part, hands down.

"Make a wet caramel,
then add the cream, butter and vanilla."

To make a wet caramelâ¦

Does that mean
that you put water in the caramel?

[nervously] I don't know.

[JÃ¼rgen] Hot water
speeds up absorption of liquid.

[Chigs] Gotta wait for this now
to go to a nice golden colour.

[JÃ¼rgen] It is starting to brown.

[Giuseppe] Now is the fun part,
pouring the cream.

It's coming, but there's some
lumps of crystals in there.

[George] This is gonna burn.

I need to add some vanilla
to take out the burning smell.

[Amanda] Doesn't look
very caramelly, does it?

[exclaiming] Ah! Oh, no.

[sighs]

[JÃ¼rgen] Should bake my tuile,

because I'll need
the oven for the pudding.

Spread the tuile mixture into a rectangle.

It's not really a rectangle, is it?

-[beeps]
-[JÃ¼rgen] Tuile is in.

There is no guidance whatsoever.
The point there is, "Bake."

Oh!

Oh, no, she died.
Do you think I can just use it?

It's fine. They won't know. [chuckles]

Oh, no. Today's just not my day.

Right.

Bakers, half of you are halfway through.

The other half have half a challenge left.

You're halfway through.

Well, this is coming out.

[Maggie] Come on.

So, we let this cool a little bit
and then I'll cut it.

And the next step
is to make the pudding batter.

I've got the chopped dates,
the self-raising flour,

butter, dark muscovado sugarâ¦

And butter. I said butter already.
And chopped dates.

I've got some butter and sugar in here.
I'm not sure if I need the flour.

I have my doubts, somehow.

I'll just read the recipe again.

-[Noel] Maggie.
-[Maggie] Hello.

[Noel] I'm gonna write number 11.

Anything will help.

-[laughs]
-"Push Paul into a ditch."

[both laughing]

Number 12,
"Maggie gets taken away by the police."

Now, when they ask you about the recipe,
go, "What are these?"

-[Maggie laughing]
-[George] What's next?

I've got butter on my face.

"Spoon some of the toffee sauce
into the pudding mould."

It's always gutting when you turn them out
and there's no sauce.

[Chigs] Divide the batter up
equally into the moulds.

[JÃ¼rgen] Looks good.

It's looking runny.
Let's stay with it, Mag.

Don't change anything now.

[JÃ¼rgen] Going in.
I'll check in 20 minutes.

I'll go for 15 minutes to start with,
and see how it goes.

[Chigs] Don't know how long for.

I'm going for 15 minutes initially
and see what happens.

[Matt] Now you got a handshake,

I was wondering if you would
get a tattoo to commemorateâ¦

[laughs] What would it look like?

A sort of greasy, chubby-fingered hand
on a part of your body.

Whereabouts?

-Well, I daren't sayâ¦
-[laughs]

Bakers, you have half an hour left.
What you doing with that?

I just get upset
when one of the bakers leaves,

so this week I'm gonna go instead.

Good idea.

I'm making the crÃ¨me anglaise.
It's just thin custard.

I've never made
a real custard with eggs before.

Not a good start. [chuckles]

[Chigs] I'm warming the milk,
cream and vanilla.

Then I'll start adding
a little milk at a time.

I can always do with a workout.

It's very fine balance
where it goes from custard to fried egg.

[Maggie] This is probably
the only thing that's right.

And if I burn this,
then I'm really stuffed.

[JÃ¼rgen] That's nice.

Oh, no! There's lumps in it.

Hot!

Feel like it definitely is scrambled.

Bakers, you have 15 minutes.

-[gasps]
-I was gonna say that.

The crÃ¨me anglaise is done.

All I have to wait
is for the puddings to cook.

-[JÃ¼rgen] They haven't collapsed.
-Nope.

Skewer's wet,
but that wet could be the caramel sauce.

I just don't want them to be raw.

[Amanda] They're rising.

I'll do them for two more minutes,
'cause they're soggy.

-You all right?
-[Maggie] I just looked in the oven.

I've got little splodgy messes
in the bottom of the pudding basins.

It's just sunken to a gluey mess.

I must have left something out.
But it's all ticked off.

-[Giuseppe] The other page is?
-[Maggie] No flour.

No, there is flour. There you go. Yeah.

Oh, right. That's what I didn't do.
I knew there was something.

-Bakers, you have five minutesâ¦
-[both] Left.

-Time to get them out.
-[timer beeps]

-Shaky.
-There's sticky toffee pudding. [chuckles]

I think I should turn them out
while they're still warm.

Are you doing a magic trick?

I will need three of those
and a little ball with that one.

-[Noel laughs]
-[Crystelle] How on earth?

Do I justâ¦ [gasps]

Come on.

I'll take that. Boom. [giggles]

[JÃ¼rgen] I think it looks puddingy.

[Amanda] Ah!
Oh, disaster. They're all raw.

[sighs] It's all over. [chuckles]

Let's go for it.

You've gotta laugh, I'll say.

Anybody watching
will feel very sorry for me. [chuckling]

Bakers, you have one minute left.

[Freya] Ay caramba!

Right. Best-looking tuiles.

They're breaking!
Should've done it while it was hot.

-How many have I done so far?
-I feel like this might be your third.

-I'll have to mash that back up.
-Mash it up.

[JÃ¼rgen] Either side.

[Amanda] Do you think they'll notice
if I squash them in?

The sauces go on the side.

-[Chigs] Toffee sauce, it's not the best.
-[Freya] True nightmare.

-I suppose that's it.
-[Maggie] Et voilÃ .

Bakers, your time is up.

Jeez, phew, that was close, eh?

Place your sticky toffee puddings
behind your photographs.

I didn't put the flour in. [laughs]

-It was just one lineâ¦
-[both] On the next page.

-Didn't see it.
-Didn't see it, did I?

[Matt] Paul and Prue are looking
for four rich, sticky toffee puddings,

silky toffee sauce, smooth crÃ¨me anglaise

and eight perfectly crispy tuiles.

-And they'll have no idea whose is whose.
-Nice.

-We got eight tuilesâ¦
-[Prue] Mmm-hmm.

â¦with a bit of a snap.

The pudding looks pretty solid.

-The crumb's good.
-The sauce is a little bit stiff.

Let's see what the anglaise is like.

[Prue] That's very good.

-[Paul] That's not bad, that.
-I must say, that is delicious.

[Paul] Okay, moving on.

We have eight tuiles, all pretty uniform.

[Prue] Really nice and thin.

-[Paul] This looks--
-[Prue] Stodgy.

[Paul] Quite raw.

-[Paul] Yeah.
-[Prue] It's very, very underbaked.

-[Paul] Eight nice tuiles.
-[Prue] Very nice tuile.

-[Paul] Nice shape.
-I'm impressed with the custards.

-Yeah.
-Perfect.

Looks a little stodgy and underbaked.

It's a pity, because I had a bit
of the cooked bit and it's delicious.

[Paul] Hmm.

-Few issues. Wow.
-[Prue] This looks like a disaster.

The sticky toffee puddings
obviously came out too early.

They've managed to bake on the outside,

-but the inside's just raw.
-[Prue] Yes.

[Paul] Not bad.
Just a little bit longer on the caramel.

-This is just on the turn.
-[Paul] Yeah, it's curdled.

We have eight fairly even tuiles.

[Prue] And rather nice-looking puddings.

[Paul] Oh, that's well-baked. It's nice.

-The anglaise is good.
-Mmm.

-[Paul] Neat tuiles.
-[Prue] Very nice.

[Paul] Sponge is good.
Overall, that's pretty decent actually.

Moving on.

-[Prue] Well, they're underdone.
-[Paul] A bit raw in the middle.

Let's have a look at the sauces.

They've gone slightly over the edge.
It's gone almost treacle.

-[Prue] Right.
-[Paul] Burnt tuiles.

-Burnt to a cinder--
-[Prue] Rather funny shape.

-[Paul] Scrambled eggs.
-[Prue] Scrambled.

And underdone caramel.

Oh, dear.

Mmm. And that is raw. That's a shame.

-[Prue] Oh, dear.
-[Paul chuckles] What is that?

[Prue] Those tuiles look really good.

-Don't they!
-[Prue chuckles]

It looks like caramelised onion chutney.

[Prue chuckles] That's exactly
what it looks like.

[Paul] Burnt to a cinder.

-[Noel] You're not gonna try?
-[Paul] I'll leave it. Thanks.

-Moving on.
-[Prue] Last one.

[Paul] These tuiles aren't too bad,
I like the colour.

-We have a baked sponge.
-[Prue] Hmm.

[Paul] Let's have a look at the caramel.

[all laughing]

-[Noel] We'll spill it out.
-[Paul] Come on.

-Do it like a bottle of ketchup, maybe.
-Come on.

[grunts]

[Paul] Ah! We have fully-fledged toffee.

-Wow.
-[Matt] Yeah, I'm in.

This is gonna be interesting.

[Noel] Paul and Prue

will now rank the sticky toffee puddings
from worst to best.

In ninth place, this one.

Oh, Maggie.
This was a fair old disaster, wasn't it?

I made for you a gluten-freeâ¦

-[all laughing]
-â¦sticky toffee pudding.

-You forget to put the flour in?
-[Maggie] Yes.

[Prue] Oh, bad luck.

In eighth spot, we have this one.

Amanda. Raw, you burnt the tuiles,

you scrambled the crÃ¨me anglaise
and caramel's not caramelised enough.

-But besides that, brilliant.
-[all chuckle]

[mouthing] Thank you.

In seventh place, we have this one.

George. Very raw puddings, sadly.

[Matt] Freya is sixth.

Crystelle is fifth.

Giuseppe, fourth and Chigs, third.

So in second spot, we haveâ¦

this one. Whose is this?

Lizzie.

Your sponge is pretty good,

crÃ¨me anglaise is good
and your caramel sauce is good. Well done.

[Prue] Which means we have JÃ¼rgen.

[all cheering]

Thank you.

Really nice sticky toffee puddings.

Very good tuile.

Excellent crÃ¨me anglaise.

Perfect sauce.

-Very good.
-Thank you.

[JÃ¼rgen] It's wonderful.

I hardly can believe it.
Winning the Technical in Dessert Week.

One I was afraid of,
but it seems I have to be afraid ofâ¦

[chuckles]

â¦to be on the spot and concentrated.

[Lizzie] Who knows what happened?

Came second, so thanks, everyone else,
for undercooking.

I will never, ever, ever, ever,
bake a sticky toffee pudding again.

My husband's the expert, I don't need to.

He's gotta be good at something.

I knew there had to be flour
and I just couldn't see it.

Nothing you can do
when you've made a very silly mistake.

I love making it really hard for myself.

So tomorrow I'll just
have to do amazingly. [chuckles]

[Noel] Just one more challenge remains

before Prue and Paul decide
Dessert Week's Star Baker.

And who will be asked to leave the tent.

Bakers, I hope you are rested and ready
for your Showstopper challenge.

[Noel] Today, Paul and Prue

would love you to make
a celebratory joconde imprime dessert.

An impressive, multi-layered dessert
wrapped in a joconde collar.

Now the collar is a key element
and must be highly decorative.

Classically, a joconde
is a whisked sponge with ground almonds.

You have four and a half hours.

Unfortunately, we've used four hours

explaining to you what this challenge is.
You got half an hour.

[Matt] Good luck.

-[Noel] On your marksâ¦
-[Matt] Get setâ¦

[Noel chuckles] Bake.

[Matt] Taken from the French nickname
for the Mona Lisa, the "joconde,"

the judges are expecting
highly decorative designs

to be baked into the baker's own
joconde collared masterpieces.

The idea is that our jocondes need to be
as decorative as the Mona Lisa.

So, no pressure.

I've been to see the Mona Lisa.
I didn't really like it that much.

I was like, "Is this it?" [chuckles]

What we're asking for
is a collar made of joconde sponge,

which has been imprinted with a design.

They can do anything they like
by way of dessert

inside this imprime collar.

[Paul] Now, they could be mousse,

they could be bavarois,
they could be crÃ¨me pat,

they could be jelly dacquoise,
anything they want.

But it's about getting it all set.

Timing has to be right.

-We're over a third of the way through.
-[timer beeping]

[Paul] And we're left
with nine fantastic bakers.

So I'm expecting the best of the best.

-Hi, Lizzie.
-Hello.

-Hello, Lizzie.
-Hello.

Lizzie, we want to hear
about your joconde imprime.

It's a Liverpool version.

So I'm doing the Liverpool skyscape
on a hazelnut joconde.

Gonna pipe it all in red and blue
for the two football clubs.

Lovely.

[Noel] Liverpool's iconic skyline
will surround Lizzie's layered dessert

of chocolate genoise sponge,

hazelnut and pecan dacquoise
and pecan parfait,

topped with a dark chocolate
and moonshine ganache.

I think it's wonderfully ambitious.
All you have to do is produce it.

You have the people
of Liverpool behind you.

Especially this one.

So, this is the design paste.
Basically, it's just a cake batter.

[Noel] To create their joconde imprime,

the bakers must begin
by piping their intricate designs.

[George] I drew out the template myself.
Just thought, "Make it look nice."

[Noel] But JÃ¼rgen's the only baker
making sure his joconde collar

not only looks the partâ¦

[humming "Pastime With Good Company"]

â¦but sounds the part too.

[JÃ¼rgen] The piece of music
is called "Pastime With Good Company."

It has been composed by Henry VIII himself

as a love song to Catherine of Aragon
from the 16th century.

[Matt] JÃ¼rgen's historical joconde imprime
will see classic Tudor flavours

in layers of English white wine jelly
with fresh strawberries, mint,

and black pepper
and white chocolate bavarois

wrapped in his
intricately-piped love song.

This is quite tricky.

Is this something you'd make at home?

Yes, I did a Star Trek one
as a wedding cake for a former--

Star Trek? [chuckling]

Two Spaceship Enterprises
kissing on the joconde.

-Wow.
-[chuckles]

[Matt] While JÃ¼rgen's
recreating the sixteenth centuryâ¦

[Amanda] I need to get a wriggle on.

â¦Amanda's heading
even further back in time.

[Amanda] It's called Adam's Temptation,

'cause I thought
I'd go with an Adam and Eve theme.

That's why I've got the serpent
climbing around the apple tree.

[Noel] Amanda's dessert
will be of biblical proportions,

containing sinfully indulgent layers

of caramelised apple jelly
and boozy Calvados bavarois.

So, are we allowed to eat this?

Will you be tempted to eat it? I hope so.

I've got this done now.

[Noel] To preserve the definition
of their detailed designsâ¦

[whimpers]

â¦the decorative paste must be firmly set

before it can be covered
with the second part of the collarâ¦

-[JÃ¼rgen] No damage.
-â¦the joconde sponge.

So, I've got almond flour.
I'm gonna fold this in gently,

you basically don't wanna
knock out the air.

It's very pliable,
so you can bend it, fold it.

Hence why you use it to make the collar.

[Matt] And after
yesterday's Technical travestyâ¦

To get this wrong is a disaster.

â¦Maggie's under even more pressure
to get her joconde right.

Just to let you know, this is plain flour.

-Really? And what do you do with that?
-You often put in sponges.

-[Maggie] Really?
-[both] It gives it a body. Yeah.

It's a bit late for this advice,
if I may say soâ¦

[Paul laughing]

[Matt] To avoid any more mistakes,
Maggie's keeping things simple.

Her strawberry patent joconde collar

will hold layers of strawberry bavarois
and strawberry coulis.

-[laughing]
-[Paul] Just to let you know.

[Maggie] Thank you.
Got a ring around the plain flour.

[Prue] He'll tease you forever.

Just think about today.
It's going to be great.

-Yes. [laughs]
-[Lizzie gasps]

Oh, cold.

[Noel] To ensure their designs
stick to the joconde spongeâ¦

It's nice and frozen.

Here it goes.

â¦speed is of the essence.

I'll have to work quickly,

otherwise the decoration will melt
and get smudged.

[Noel] But Chigs
is gonna have to work twice as fast.

A lot of people are doing one tier,
but I'm going for two.

Go big or go home.

[Matt] Based on his sister's
new bathroom tiles,

Chigs' geometric patterned joconde collars

will wrap around
black forest-flavoured layers

of cherry mousse, cherry jelly
and chocolate bavarois

for his ambitious two-tiered dessert.

[Noel] How do you motivate yourself?

[Chigs] I compete against myself.
I want to be better.

That's what my comedy agent used to say.

"Don't look at others,
just concentrate on yourself."

Exactly. And look how far you've got.

-Ahâ¦
-You're doing well.

-Now I'm in a baking show.
-[both chuckle]

[Matt] And Chigs isn't the only baker

taking his joconde imprime
to the next level.

[George] I'm going for two tiers.

Just feel like I haven't
impressed Paul and Prue much

and I just want to
show them what I can do.

[Noel] George's joconde imprime

will be decorated with a flower design
inspired by his mum's garden.

Inside, there'll be layers
of caramel chocolate mousse,

dark chocolate-coated peanuts
and peanut butter bavarois.

Can you spell bavarois?

-B-A-V-O-I-R?
-No.

-Have you asked anyone else?
-No. Should we ask Amanda?

-Amanda, spell bavarois.
-Yes.

B-A-V-A-R-O-I-S?

Well done, madam. Well done.

The verdict is in, not guilty.

So, joconde goes in.

[Amanda] I'm gonna go
with ten minutes first.

They don't take long,
'cause they're so thin.

[Noel] When baking thin
and delicate spongesâ¦

Setting timer to seven.

â¦timings and temperatures
are more crucial than ever.

[Crystelle] Both my sponges have gone in
for eight minutes at 200 degrees.

Fingers crossed.

[Noel] Underbaked joconde
will be too soft to stand up,

resulting in saggy collars.

[sighs] I'll just have to hope it bakes.

That's never happened before.

[Noel] Overbaked
and it will become too dry

and crack when wrapped
around their desserts.

[timer beeping]

[Freya] I'm gonna test them.

She can come out.

-[Lizzie] I'm out.
-[Maggie] Is it actually cooked enough?

I don't want to overdo it.

I don't know if the pattern
is still gonna be there.

We'll see.

[Chigs] Why's it gone so quiet?

Oh, it's sticking. I need a knife.

[Lizzie] I'm happy with how it's came out.

[JÃ¼rgen] It looks great.

[Freya] Oh, my God.
The pattern's come off.

-Should I just stick with it?
-Will you make it again?

You ain't got time.

[Maggie] It isn't quite cooked.

I didn't cook it long enough. I panicked.

I just don't want to make a mess of this,
so I am actually going to do it again.

Bakers, you're halfway through.

[Maggie] I did this
so precisely the first time.

He wants such a high finish,
doesn't he? [laughing]

I know. But you know, I want
a high finish when I deliver a baby.

-[both chuckle]
-Soâ¦

[Noel] How many babies have you delivered?

No idea, but every single one
was like the first one.

[Noel] Just remember, making a joconde
collar isn't a profound experience.

Delivering a baby is.

-That's so true.
-Stick that in your pipe, Paul Hollywood.

Take that with me.

[Matt] While Maggie
remakes her joconde collarâ¦

[Maggie] This is the difference
between going home and staying.

â¦the rest of the bakers
can begin the monumental taskâ¦

-Whoopsie-daisies.
-Whoops.

[George] The pressure is mounting.

â¦of creating the multiple mousses,
jellies and sponges.

This is the most complicated thing
I have ever made in my entire life.

[Matt] But that's not stopping Giuseppe

from following
in his father's revered footsteps.

My dad was a professional chef
and a passionate baker.

I took inspiration from one of the most
beautiful wedding cakes

that he made for a family friend.

Mine is not gonna be as grand as my dad's.

I can only try to be as fractionally
good as he's ever been.

[Matt] Giuseppe's joconde imprime dessert
will see layers of Genoise Sponge

with pistachio and red fruit bavarois,
decorated with fresh fruits

in an epic recreation
of his dad's wedding cake.

You have, by any chance, a spare bench?
'Cause I--

-[Noel giggling]
-I've clearly run out of space here.

Look how clean his bench is.

-It's weird isn't it?
-That's German engineering.

-So freakish.
-German engineering.

You don't expect the Italian engineering
to be, you knowâ¦

Not quite as good.
It's a little haphazard.

-But, you know, the results are good.
-Yeah, we get the job done.

-You get the job done.
-Yeah.

[sighs]

[Noel] With so many
different layers to makeâ¦

[Amanda] Trouble is,
it's only one arm, isn't it?

â¦the bakers must ensure
that every element is perfectly set.

[JÃ¼rgen] I'll start with the wine

because the alcohol works
against the setting.

So, a bowl of some alcohol.

[Noel] And JÃ¼rgen's not the only oneâ¦

Five, sixâ¦ Oh! Seven.

â¦risking hitting the bottle.

[Crystelle] This is coconut rum.

It's called, "Una PiÃ±a Colada, Por Favor."
[giggles]

It's just holiday in a drink.

[Noel] To bring back distant memories
of sipping cocktails in the sun,

Crystelle's dessert
will resemble a pineapple

and hold layers of pineapple
and coconut rum compote,

lime jelly and coconut bavarois.

How many leaves of gelatin
are you putting in there?

-Six, seven?
-Uh, so in the bavarois, there's 13.

[Paul] Wow.

[Prue] Oh, my goodness,
you are a brave girl.

-[Matt] Good luck.
-Thank you, will need it.

[Matt] While the rest of the bakers
are relying on their gelatinâ¦

The tofu gives, like,
a really smooth, like, mousse.

â¦vegan Freya
is having to get creative once again.

You don't really
have problems with it setting

because it just, like,
resets back like tofu.

[Matt] In a rectangular joconde imprime,

Freya's chocolate and orange mousse
will be accompanied by orange jelly,

as well as layers of hazelnut dacquoise

and Italian meringue buttercream.

Made once again
with her vegan egg white substitute.

You're using Swiss Meringue
and dacquoise as well.

A lot of aquafaba going in this.

It seems like a lot.

-[Paul] Right.
-But it's actually not that much.

I hope it's gonna be one of those things

that you just, like,
would never know that it's vegan.

That's my goal, anyway.

-Bakers--
-Bakers, you've--

-[both laughing]
-Have an hour left.

[yelling in exasperation]

We're going in for eight right now.

[Matt] While Maggie is back
to baking her joconde collarâ¦

[Maggie] Live dangerously,
that's what I like to do.

â¦for the rest of the bakersâ¦

[Crystelle] Oh, this is so tense.

â¦cake construction can commence.

Time is key now.
So everything sets in time.

Everybody's terrified
about collapsing cakes.

[Matt] But it's a process
that can't be rushedâ¦

I'm gonna put the base layer in first.

It's important that it's nice
and tight and snug.

â¦as any gaps or cracks in the collarâ¦

Oh, careful, George.

â¦and the fillings will ooze out
before they can set.

I'll just block up the holes.

Thank goodness for extras.

[Chigs] Cherry mousse, going in first.

[Prue] Almost all the of the bakers

are doing quite complicated constructions,
aren't they?

[Paul] It's a really tricky challenge.

[Freya] It doesn't look like tofu now,
does it?

-Freya, that's the hardest job.
-[Prue] Yeah.

Doing a vegan joconde and vegan fillings

and vegan bavarois.

[Matt] So you're doing not a round collar?

A bit of tactics because the vegan sponge
is not very bendy.

Actually, I'm more worried
about Crystelle.

Because she has that piÃ±a colada bavarois.

[Crystelle] It's so risky,
because if that bavarois is not set,

the whole thing just collapses.

I've just got to go for it now.

[Prue] I'm worried about Maggie.

-Their main challenge is going to be time.
-[Paul] It's gonna be hard, Prue.

It's brownish. What more can I do?

[Amanda] This is apple jelly.

[gasps]

No!

And we're winging it.

[sighs]

Making sure that it's all level and now,
this can finally go in the freezer.

-[thuds]
-Oh, my God.

-[Noel] Gently does it.
-[Crystelle laughs]

-Did the puppet walk.
-I did. I know. Mortifying.

[Amanda] It just needs to set.

Bakers, you have half an hour left.

Sort it out!

I can't believe people
get paid for doing that.

Amanda, neither can we.

I am confident it's going to set.
Set! [chuckles]

[Matt] While their cakes coolâ¦

[George] Hopefully,
it's doing its thing in there.

â¦things are heating up for the bakersâ¦

It's all go, go, go.

â¦as they still have their final
layers and decorations to make.

I'm preparing the final element
of my cake which is the mirror glaze.

[Crystelle] I'm making my lime jelly,
which will go on the top.

My bavarois, which is setting and should
be set in 16 seconds, apparently.

[both cheering]

[timer beeping]

[JÃ¼rgen] I'll check on the bavarois.

Yeah, it's good enough.

This is so tense,
because if that bavarois has not set,

then you'll watch me crumble
and burn, like my joconde.

Oh, tension!

Mirror glaze, still quite warm,
but it should be okay. Gonna put it on.

[Maggie] That's the strawberry coulis.

Hoping that it doesn't leak out
when I take it out of the mould.

[Maggie] This is gonna go splodge.

[JÃ¼rgen] I'm going to pour
the jelly in the freezer.

[Chigs] No more layers,
this is all decoration now.

Chigs, you're shaking the entire ground.

-Don't wobble this piece of floor.
-[Chigs] Soz.

Bakers, you have ten minutes left.

Shall I take it out?

Coming out.

[Crystelle] Right.
Come on, jelly. Please be set.

Life has never felt more tense.

It's still quite liquid, but I'm gonna
go in. I can't wait any longer.

[Freya] Is that just gonna fall apart?

It's standing still, so I'm all right.

There we go.
It looks like the jelly didn't leak.

[Amanda gasps]

Ah! It's all coming out!

My thing's leaked a little bit.

[breathing heavily]

It's not set properly.

I can't take the collar off
'cause it's going to completely collapse.

[George] I think it's getting stuck
on the peanut layer.

I'm a happy man now, yeah.

Get in there.

Bakers, you have one minute left.

Shall we go for it now?
I can hold it till they say, "walk away."

It's beastly unfair
that it hasn't behaved.

[exhales deeply]

[Crystelle] Shaking.

Bakers, your time is up.

[Noel] Please step away from your bakes.

[Maggie chuckling] There we go.
The avalanche has started.

We might as well go out with a bang.

[Noel] It's judgement time
for our bakers' joconde imprimes.

JÃ¼rgen, would you like to bring
your Showstopper up, please?

Well, I think it looks absolutely amazing.

[Paul] The wine jelly.
You've got a few little bubbles in there.

But I like the way it's set.
That view looks lovely.

That cut through beautifully.

-Wow.
-[JÃ¼rgen] It's topped by wine jelly.

Then white chocolate Bavarian
with black pepper.

Then a genoise and then at the bottom
there's a hazelnut dacquoise.

That is such a luxurious, creamy,
boozy mouthful.

Your textures of everything are gorgeous.

-I can't get the black pepper.
-No, I'm looking for the pepper.

Usually it comes a bit later.

-Okay, let's just wait for a minute.
-[all chuckling]

[Paul] If you'd like to sing.

[humming "Pastime With Good Company"]

-[clapping]
-That's very familiar.

-Got the pepper.
-[JÃ¼rgen] Got the pepper?

[all laughing]

Excellent.

This is inspired
by a crime scene that I went to.

[all laughing]

When I was very young in service.

So I think you struggled with the joconde.

And the dam has broken
when it was still trying to set.

[Amanda] It's genoise sponge
with Calvados Bavarian cream,

with caramelised apple jelly.

And the top is a maple syrup glaze.

They look like very beautiful layers. Mmm.

You know, it tastes absolutely delicious,
but it does not taste a lot of apple.

You're getting more
of an alcoholic flavour.

The texture of everything is great.

But unfortunately you drowned
everything out with that Calvados.

You've lost some of the definition,
but it's pretty.

I think overall,
it's quite a professional-looking piece.

Very, very elegant.

The filling is two types of bavarois,
pistachio and raspberry and strawberry.

[Paul] Mmm, great layers.

Oh, look at that, soft as anything.

-Beautiful.
-Oh.

Great flavours. Great acidity.

The genoise has been baked beautifully.
It's lovely and soft.

I mean, you'd serve that
at a decent hotel.

-How many stars?
-Oh, a good five.

-[Prue] Excellent.
-Thank you very much.

[Matt and Noel] Well done.

The bin's for you.

-"I'm wheelie born in Liverpool."
-[Paul] Oh, right, yeah.

-[all laughing]
-I love it.

You got the Liverpool skyline,
which is pretty cool.

It's a bit rudimentary.

[chuckling] Dacquoise is
a little bit tough.

[Prue] It's hard work, Lizzie.

[Paul] I think your texture's all wrong,
but your flavours are beautiful.

-It's wheelie good.
-There you go.

[all laughing]

[Paul] Well, I think it looks beautiful.
The pipework is particularly good.

Simple, but effective. [clicks tongue]

[Prue] Those layers are really lovely.

They're very powerful flavours.

The coconut and lime
is just beautiful. Mmm.

The lime, it's so powerful.
I would've pulled that back a little bit.

But everything else I'm happy with.
Thank you.

[Prue] I like the flower patterns.

But where the joins are,
it's a bit clumsy. It's sort of lopsided.

-Well, what am I--
-The peanut layer.

Oh, literally you've got
a layer of peanuts.

[crunching]

You certainly get the peanut flavour
and the peanut crunch.

[Paul] That peanut layer is ridiculous.
Can't get through it.

I think you've just gone overkill
with the peanuts.

-I quite like peanuts.
-[all laughing]

[Paul] It looks amazing.
The joconde's well done.

-I mean, this was taken from a tile.
-[Chigs chuckles] Yeah.

And it's so original
and it looks startling.

-Thank you.
-[Paul] And two tiers.

Looks like a delicious bathroom.

[chuckles]

The bavarois are perfection.
They are perfection.

Your flavours
and your textures are superb.

They're just firm enough to stay up.

I mean, it's really clever.

I don't even like Black Forest gateau
and I love that.

Thank you.

[Prue] You've lost some of the imprime.

It's a bit messy,
but let's have a look inside, shall we?

[Freya] The joconde is chocolate hazelnut.

Then there's a hazelnut dacquoise

and then a layer
of Italian meringue buttercream,

then a chocolate orange mousse

and then on top, it's orange jelly.

[Paul] It's set quite hard.
It's more like a ganache.

-Yeah, yeah.
-[Paul] The mousse.

-I think the orange is too strong.
-[Paul] So strong.

[Prue] But I actually think
your joconde is really good.

Thank you.

It needed a cream, it needed something
in there to hold everything together.

I've had some beautiful vegan cakes.

It's not one of the better ones.

See the Dam Busters have been in.

[laughing]

Let's have a look at it.

[Prue] Well, it's a very pretty colour.

Mmm.

Maggie, the flavour is lovely.
It's the essence of summer.

The strawberries are just beautiful.

[Paul] Where's your second
element in this?

The bavarois and the coulis.

[Paul] Ah, that's the second element.

What have you been doing
for four and a half hours?

-Doing it twice.
-[Paul] Ah, did you do it twice?

-Flavours are lovely.
-[Prue] And the joconde is good.

-Thank you so much.
-[Paul] Thank you.

You've been more than kind.

[Maggie chuckling] It was what it was.

They did say it tasted lovely,
but I think they were just being kind.

Really happy with what I delivered.

Think I might be up for consideration
for Star Baker.

But Giuseppe's and JÃ¼rgen's,
theirs is just another level.

[Freya] I feel like
that was pretty brutal,

to be honest with you.

It's not that I don't agree.

But, like, I kinda just don't agree.

[laughs]

Well, that Showstopper
ran the gamut, didn't it?

[Paul] Giuseppe, JÃ¼rgen, Chigs.

I think they've all done
quite well out of this.

-JÃ¼rgen's was an amazing concept.
-I think JÃ¼rgen's was beautiful.

But if you have another look
at Chigs', it's still holding well.

All the layers were there.
The taste was delicious.

-Fantastic flavour.
-[Paul] Some of them did collapse.

There was a couple of people that messed
up a bit with textures and flavours.

You look at Maggie, she classed the puree
on top as a second element.

That's not the case.

-You're not buying it.
-[Paul] I'm not buying it.

It split as well.
I mean, it poured out all over the place.

But also
I was really disappointed in Freya.

Because although she did better
with the dacquoise in this,

it was far too thick.

[Paul] That was very dry.

But then you look at Amanda's,

the Calvados in that bavarois
was the only thing you could taste.

-And it split.
-But it tasted nice.

You gotta look back
on the two challenges as well.

We'll have another cup of tea
and another slice of cake,

-and then we'll make a decision.
-Slice of cake.

[mimics Worzel Gummidge] Cup of tea
and a slice of cake, Aunt Sally.

Well, bakers,
thank you for another great week.

It falls to me to announce
who the Star Baker is.

And that person isâ¦

Chigs.

-[Matt] Congratulations!
-[cheering]

Okay, bakers, that means
that I've got the horrible job this week

of announcing the person who's leaving us,

and we're really gonna miss them.

The person who's leaving us this week isâ¦

Maggie.

It's been such good fun.
[chuckling] It's been suchâ¦

[Prue] Maggie, honestly,
you've done so well.

[Maggie] The whole thing
has been such fun, really.

And just to have been part of it
is just a complete joy.

[Matt] We're going to miss you so much.

To have stayed for four weeks.
I think it comes pretty high, really.

On a personal level,
nothing can beat delivering a baby.

And bringing a new life into the world.

But it comes quite second.

Just having a bad week.

-You'll have a good week next week.
-Thank you, I will.

Ah, God. Nightmare. [laughs]

I feel like
I definitely scraped through that.

Glad to be here,
but I'm really sad to see Maggie go.

-[Paul] Well done, Chigs.
-Thank you very much, Paul.

[sighs in relief]

[Chigs] What the hell just happened?

Thank you.

Get a handshake
and Star Baker in the same week.

[Crystelle] Oh, you bloody smashed it.

Can't believe it. I'm honestlyâ¦
I am so speechless right now.

It never happens. But I'm lost for words.

[Paul] I think Chigs
smashed it out the park.

I think all three challenges,
he was exceptionally good.

I mean, for a guy who said
he'd been baking up to 12 months ago,

he's done an amazing job.

I got Star Baker, Mum.

-[Chigs' mother] Am I on TV?
-Yeah!

[Chigs' mother laughing]

-Congratulations, I'm so proud of you!
-Thank you, Mum.

-So proud of you. I love you.
-Thank you. I love you too!

[uplifting music playing]
Breathe in. Ah.

Worst thing that could happen
is that I will be walking towards

the judges and I will trip over
and go headfirst into my own cake.

SHATTERING Oh! Oh, my God!

Oh, no.

Once again, we've
pitched our tent in the stunning

grounds of Down Hall, and our fresh
bubble of bakers are about to

face three cake-based challenges,

after which one of them will be
crowned Star Baker

and another will have to leave
the competition.

Bakers, welcome to the tent.
This is so exciting.

The winner of the 2021 Bake Off
is actually in this tent.

Whoa. How about that?

By the same token, the first person
to go home is also in this tent.

LAUGHTER It's none of you, don't worry.

It's Paul.

For your first Signature Challenge,
the judges would like you to

bake 12 decorative mini rolls.

These need to be your take on
mini rolls, so the type of sponge,

the flavours and the fillings
is entirely up to you.

You have two hours.

On your marks... Get set...

Bake!

Here we go,
it's lovely to start it, actually.

This is really happening, innit?
It's still shocking.

It's still not settled in yet.

I think I just need to put myself
back in my kitchen

and just get on with it.

I feel sick. Why did I apply
for this? What is wrong with me?

The mini roll packs a punch
in such a small little cake.

Think of the sponge,
think of the filling

and think of the overall look.

They have to be very elegant,
perfect swirl of filling inside.

And most of all
they must be delicious.

If the bakers get their timing
all wrong, there will be issues.

Cos as they put their filling
into a warm sponge,

it will collapse, ooze out.

It's the first time the bakers have
really got to impress us

and really show us what they can do.

Good morning. Good morning.
Hello, Crystelle.

Hi. Hello. Hi, how are you doing?

I want to know
about your mini rolls.

It's a chai-flavoured sponge,
so I've got jaggery. So jaggery's

like an unrefined sugar and it's
actually from Goa. So my grandma

gave me loads of jaggery from Goa,
so I'm putting that in my sponge.

Crystelle is a client
relationship manager

and lives in north London
with her parents and sisters.

But she's not been
able to see her nana Julie

and give her a hug for over a year.

Nana Julie's jaggery will sweeten
her coconut and chai tea mini rolls,

flavoured with cloves, ginger,
cinnamon and cardamom.

PAUL: That's strong, punchy
flavours for a mini roll.

What is so lovely is
the idea of coconut and chai. Yeah.

I've never had those two together.

Yeah. And I think
that might be wonderful.

Well, thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you. Good luck.

NOEL: Crystelle's not the only baker
paying

tribute to their family heritage.
I am from the Black Forest and, uh,

Black Forest gateau
has always been a favourite.

Jurgen works in IT
and with his wife Sophia

and son Benjamin loves to
play his trombone to serenade

the Brighton waterfront...

..along with his pet rabbit
Humphrey.

Great.

His classic Black Forest mini roll
will have a chocolate genoise sponge

filled with kirsch cream
and sour cherries.

Hello, there, Jurgen, how are you?

Hi, Matt, yes, I'm very well,
thank you.

You're a musical man. Yes. I thought
you might appreciate, uh, me

singing the theme
to the Flintstones in German.

I would. Here we go. Yeah.

♪ Flintstones
Begegnen Sie den Flintstones

Wilhelmina! What do you think?

Great, I haven't heard that in ages.

I translated it myself. Hmm!

I can't quite remember the text.

Well... But...

I wouldn't call it a text.

So my theme is
a Black Forest mini roll.

I'm a bit worried about Jurgen
doing it

cos I think he said
he has family from the Black Forest.

So I'm thinking
he probably knows his stuff.

Tom and his family
are from Maidstone, in Kent

and run a model railway business.

Got people waiting for the train.

He'll fill his Black Forest
mini rolls with a cherry jam

before coating them
in thick dark chocolate.

Hi, Tom. You seem like you're
enjoying yourself.

Yeah, I mean, if I'm going to go
home week one, I need to enjoy
myself.

You are not going home week one.

You've got a good vibe and I think

your energy's gonna make it happen
for you.

Awesome. Thank you very much.
So I sound like a tarot reader.

You do. I didn't wanna say it.

You know when someone says
you've got a good vibe that means

you're not very good at baking.
Yeah!

Vibe's good, cakes taste like...

I am not copying Tom,
I am doing my own Black Forest.

Wild-swimming enthusiast
Amanda is a mum of two

and works as a detective
for the Metropolitan Police.

Not too cold, but cold enough.

She's adding a coffee twist to a
squad of cherry-topped mini rolls

that should set her apart
from her Black Forest rivals.

I thought I'd make them
standing up like little soldiers.

Yeah, like cherry soldiers
I'm gonna call them.

And it's gonna stand up?

They did stand up at home. Good.

Unless the bakers create
a sponge that's light and soft...

My sponge is a genoise
and it's getting beautiful volume.

..their mini rolls won't roll.

I am making carrot cake mini rolls.

And Rochica is risking
an unconventional batter.

I have spelt flour for my dad

because these rolls
were inspired by him.

Rochica works in HR and loves
to escape the home office to see

her nieces
and nephews with her dad Colin.

Dad!

LAUGHTER

Cinnamon and vanilla cream will
fill Colin's favourite spelt flour

carrot cake mini rolls.

He really enjoys my bakes
with spelt flour in it.

He's quite health conscious.

Whilst Rochica is rolling with
an unusual flour...

One, two, three.

..Maggie has decided not to
use any at all...

19 and 20.

..choosing, instead,
a tricky meringue-based batter.

This is a very dull time -
17, 18, 19, 20.

It's 20 seconds between every
spoonful.

George, sing for me.
I'm a terrible singer, Maggie.

I'm sorry.

Sports fanatic Maggie is a retired
midwife from Poole in Dorset

and has been baking
for over 60 years.

I was never,
ever going to reach that.

I still think I'm 20.

She plans to top her light flourless
chocolate orange mini rolls

with heavenly milk chocolate angels.

It's quite a difficult sponge
to do, a flourless one.

Yeah. Because it's very mousse-y
and it's sticky and it...

Yes, but it's very delicious
when it's right.

It's very delicious when it's right.

Have you practised this, Prue?
Um, Maggie.

Don't you start!
Were you separated at birth?

LAUGHTER

I think,
I think you're gonna do well.

We can sort him out,
we can sort him out.

Whilst Prue, I mean
Maggie, is going flourless...

This is aquafaba
that I've just whisked up.

..Freya is going dairy-free.

I have tried about
15 swiss roll recipes.

Uh, cried at about 12.

19-year-old Freya is a psychology
student from Scarborough.

She went vegan 18 months ago.

That is a very big circle.

Honestly, all I do
is get insults around here.

Her lemon and raspberry mini rolls
will be filled with a vegan

lemon meringue buttercream.
Are you the youngest in here?

Yeah. I think I'm the youngest
by... How old are you?

How old are you, 12? I'm... I'm 19.

You know there's
a Junior Bake Off, right?

So Junior Bake Off said no, they put
you into the main one,

which is a bit unfair.
Yeah. But fingers crossed.

There's always the
technical and the showstopper.

And those are generally easy, so...
Yeah, they sound way better, eh?

Good luck. Here we go.

The sooner the mini roll sponges
are baked,

the longer they'll have to cool.

We're on the way.

Please be good to me.

Nine minutes. Is the plan.

Ten minutes and counting.

If the bakers
attempt to fill a warm sponge...

I'm starting to panic
cos I can hear everyone putting

stuff in the oven
and I've got nothing.

..their first-ever Signature Bake
will end in collapse.

Oh, my God - my oven door was open.

Oh. BLEEP!

George works with carers and adults

with learning disabilities
in north London.

He loves to recreate
the Greek Cypriot bakes

he grew up with at home
with his wife Oz,

his kids Nasis, Alarah and Elise
and their dog Ely.

Who's gonna do the washing-up?

DOG WHIMPERS

His milk chocolate mini rolls will
be filled with a hazelnut bavarois.

While the oven's warming up

I'll move onto something else cos
I need to.

George isn't the only one
running late.

Why are you at this stage
and not further down the line?

Clearly, just a slow person.

There's a plan behind this pattern.

Yeah, so it is meant to be
a giraffe and they're based on

going to Chester Zoo with my family.

You've got a dog, haven't you? Yeah.

What's your dog called?
Prudence.

Prudence. Prudence.

Yeah, well, I've got
photos of yous all on my mixer.

Paul, you've got a six-pack. I know!

LAUGHTER

Lizzie is from Liverpool and
when she's not at home baking with

the judges,
she builds luxury cars for a living.

Her giraffe print coffee sponge

will be rolled around a tahini
caramel filling.

Me and you have
got our wardrobes confused.

I mean, I think
this could be an issue.

We can just share clothes.
If I last more than one week.

I am a bit behind.
Don't worry about that so much.

I feel like it's gonna
look good cos you've got style.

Oh, have you seen my shoes?

Ears and tail.
I do like those shoes.

Don't let anyone see how
big my heels are, I'm like Prince.

I take these off, you will only see
the top of my head.

I've gotta go apparently cos
apparently you need

to get on with some baking.
This is a baking show. Good luck.

See ya.

Bakers. You are halfway through.

Can't be halfway?

The competition - you slept through
a couple of episodes.

LAUGHTER

Straight in the oven.

I think I'll be able to breathe
once I've got that done.

Oh, that's my timer.

Here we go -
right, let's check this guy out.

Can't see, mind you. Oh.

When baking thin
and fragile sponges...

It's a bit spongey but I'd
just like another couple of minutes.

..every second counts.
No, one more minute.

Just a fraction
too long in the oven...

It's coming out in about a minute.

..when rolled,
they'll crack and fall apart.

Now I'm gonna turn this out.

Please be careful,
I don't wanna burn any of you lot.
So do you enjoy baking?

Well, I've only been baking 12
months. Right. So I'm a proper...

Oh, my goodness... lockdown baker.

Chigs is a telephone
sales manager from Leicester.

And as well as baking,
lockdown has seen him rock climbing,

playing guitar, decorating his house
and cooking with his mum Joyti.

His marbled chocolate and vanilla
sponge will be filled

with a strawberry Chantilly cream.

The first Bake Off that I was
a judge for, the winner had only

been baking for six months. Oh, wow!

It's not necessarily
a handicap. Exactly.

In the last series, the winner had
only been baking for 13 or 14 years.

Oh, there you go, then!

I'm waiting on my sponges.

Helpless, aren't you?
A sitting duck.

Whilst the wait continues for Lizzie
and George

with sponges cooling,

the rest of the bakers still need to
perfect their fillings.

How are you?
Are you about to have a swig?

Has it got that bad already?

No, this is the syrup,
that's the stuff you wanna swig.

That's the stuff. Yeah.
Are you drunk yet? I am.

Are you? No, I'm not really.

Good on you. Course I'm not,
you weren't sure then!

I was just thinking, "Lucky you."

LAUGHTER

And Giuseppe's filling is
a taste of home.

I'm trying to translate
Italian flavours into whatever I'm

putting together.

That's part of my heritage,
that's... that's what I do best.

Giuseppe works as an engineer
in Bristol and passes on his Italian

culinary heritage to his three sons,
Alberto, Ricardo and Georgio.

No, no, no, don't pull it.

We still have to eat it.
This is dinner, amore.

He's filling his almond and
orange sponges with ricotta cheese

flavoured with
a potent orange blossom water.

Hopefully balanced enough
not to blow anybody's heads off.

But Jairzeno isn't holding back.

20 passion fruit to
make some passion fruit caramel.

Originally from Trinidad,
Jairzeno is a finance manager living

in south London with his partner
Graham and their greyhound Maxie.

Shall we find some squirrels?

His passion fruit caramel
buttercream will fill a lime

and chilli sponge.

How far do you think you can
go in the competition?

Would I like to go all the way? Yes.

You would? Yes.

That's what I wanna hear.
Yes. Don't you worry!

I'll take care of the rest. Oh, OK.

I'll take them out one by one, OK?

Who do you want to go first?

Freya? Well, that's harsh.
I wasn't expecting that.

No, no comment.

LAUGHTER

Bakers, you have had half an hour.

No, no, no.
They've got half an hour.

Oh, you've got half an hour left.
That makes more sense.

Lovely, thank you very much.

Same difference, isn't it? No. Oh.

That's panicked me.
So I'm, like, miles behind.

I hope that these cool in time.

As George
and Lizzie finally begin cooling...

Come on, come on, come on. Ah!

For the rest of the bakers,
it's the moment of truth.

It is the orange buttercream.
I've hopefully cooled the sponges

enough so it won't melt.

The cherries go on the edge.

As a child, if in any of the cafes
this filling was missing

I was a very unhappy child.

That's a strong smell, Jurgen.

What is that? Kirsch syrup. Wow.

BLOWS AIR THROUGH LIPS

Compose myself.

Right, come on, just do it.

Cos they're mini, you've got to
get it really tight.

Paul and Prue have demanded
a perfectly defined swirl.

I try to roll them like sushi.

We often make sushi at home.

But if the sponge is even
a fraction overbaked...

Come on!

..it will split.

It can't crack, cos if it cracks

then you don't get your perfect
swirl.

Not perfect, but whatever.

SHE SIGHS

I'm trying to keep it
all in one piece.

Swirl is coming out nicely.

There's a swirl.
Stay, stay, stay, stay.

Oh, there is a crack.

I'm gonna hide that.
Quite a lot of cracking.

Which is why I'm covering
them in something to make them

a bit more attractive. This is the
fiddly bit cos I do not like

doing equal measurements on
anything. We need a ruler.

Anyone got a ruler? This is the best
tool of an engineer - a ruler.

They should be
exactly eight centimetres each.

How long have we got?

Bakers, you've got 15 minutes
until the end of this challenge. Ah!

We haven't got much time left.

It's a bit hotter than what
I would like

but I ain't got time to mess around.
There you go.

The sickness is setting in.

I feel like it's just hit me
like a slap in the face.

Oy, yai, yai. Come on!

Roll. Oh.

How are you? All over the place
at the moment. Are you?

When you have disasters at home,
it doesn't really matter.

But here, it's
just like pressure's on.

I'm gonna leave you
cos that looks really tricky.

Good luck, George, use the Force.
Yeah, I will.

The caramel's
probably gonna be running out.

The coffee cream's gonna melt.

Oh!

You've come right at the right
moment if you like chocolate.

I do like chocolate. Cos this is
about to go all over those.

All right, here we go. This is what
I call covering up the cracks.

They're not too bad.

Covering the cracks up with
chocolate

so they won't know any different.
I'm dipping one end.

I didn't want to coat it entirely
cos I like to see the swirl.

Oh, man. They taste wicked.

But they look like...

Bakers, you have five minutes left.

Perfect.

Should get there in five.

My soldiers are falling over.
Covering the cracks, round two.

What are you doing? Is this baking?
Yes. Stop it.

Of course it's baking.
Are you just making these hairy?

Please help me, someone.

More chocolate. A few minutes to go,
people are flapping

but you're cool as a cucumber.
What's cucumber in Italian?

Cetriolo. You're cool as a...

A cetriolo... cucumber.

Now, little angels. Ah!

This has lost its body.

My hands are too hot. Ah.

Oh, another broken angel.
Oh, no.

Well, you might just
have to have one angel.

There's caramel everywhere.

Stick some flowers on it
and hopefully cover up all my sins.

These are very, very drunk.

So the photos are me and me family

when we go to the zoo every
Christmas. I'm shaking, I'm shaking.

How many seconds?

Bakers, you have one minute left.

So this is my jaggery whipped cream.

This is me trying to be fancy.

Have some gooeyness.

Right, that will have to do.

Bakers, your time is up.

Ah! Can I walk out now?

Ah,
it's dripping on everyone's faces.

Oh, my white chocolate ganache is
dripping off my stool.

Ah!

That's cake carnage.

Oh, no, your floor,
the coconut on the floor.

My mum is gonna kill me.

She was like,
"Crystelle, please be neat."

Oh, God.

Our 12 new bakers

and their mini rolls are
about to face Paul

and Prue for the very first time.

Hello, Maggie. Hello.
Still smiling I see.

One has to.

I wanted them all to have a little
angel on top,

but I'm afraid I must admit to
having the shakes

and they kept
losing their wings.

Well, one of them's got it.

The chocolate is a little bit rough
and ready.

You've got a nice little
swirl in there, actually.

I think your sponge is excellent.
Thank you so much.

Texture of it's lovely.
Great flavour.

You couldn't eat a lot of it,
because it is so rich.

The cocoa content's quite high.
Yes.

My husband would find this far
too much chocolate.

He'd like a milk chocolate.
Oh! Oh, for heaven's sake.

He likes adulterated chocolate.

This is pure... This is
chocolate! ..dark.

Loving listening to you
and Prue chat.

I've never felt more like a chimney
sweep in all my life.

Lawks! Come on, let's go, Paul,
let's go.

It's like a Dickens novel.

There's a sort of fold in there,

not a swirl.

The bitterness from the sugar
is perfect.

And the passion fruit is
absolutely delicious.

Is it so worth the calories.

That is wonderful.

They are a bit uneven.

I think they're a little bit drunk.

I don't think that's a swirl.
No. It's a blob.

Cherry's not strong enough,
cos it blended so much

with a little bit of coffee in
there.

Nice lot of booze,
though. I like the booze.

Not much of a mini roll.
You know, it's not at all bad,

because you have got
a bit of a swirl. Thank you.

The texture of the cake is lovely.
Thank you very much.

But you're not getting
enough of the cherry coming through.

They're pretty neat.
I think they look rather attractive.

Oh! Let's see what
they look like inside, shall we?

Don't want to look.

There's not much of a swirl
in there, is there?

There's like an abstract swirl.

I think maybe the cream
kind of hides the swirl.

I have to tell you it's delicious.

Oh! I think you've got a great
blend of the spices,

but more so the cardamom and
the coconut together

work beautifully well.

My only complaint is there's
a touch too much jaggery.

OK. It's too sweet.

That's absolutely fine.
I'll take that.

Too hot. Bad timing.

Rushing. Maybe a bit of panic,
as well.

Hm.

It's pudding.

It's not cake.
It's still warm.

And the whole thing's collapsed,
because you put a massive
amount of chocolate.

There's a famous saying in Cyprus
which you will probably be

more than aware of - siga, siga.
Yeah.

What does that mean?
Slowly, slowly.

Yeah. Slowly, slowly.

You've got a fairly good swirl.

I think the flavours are lovely.
It is a little stodgy.

Even with spelt in, you've
managed to over-mix it.

Oh, OK.
And so it's too rubbery.

There was a bit of a wind in the
forest. The forest suffered a storm.

The Black Forest is not entirely
healthy.

A nice bit of a swirl in there.

You haven't over-sweetened
the filling,

so you get that sour cherry.
You're from the Black Forest?

Yes.

Try some.

What do you think?
I would buy it. Why?

The balance between cream,
chocolate is right.

And you have enough sour cherry,
and not sweet.

I agree. I agree entirely.
Thank you.

Just needs to be neater.
Just judge your own cake.

It's very, very good.
Well done. Thank you very much.
Well done.

I'm going to eat a bit.

Black Forest from the Black Forest.

Mmm.

I'm full of admiration for you,

because on the few occasions
that I've tried to use aquafaba

instead of egg whites, it takes
ages. Oh, yeah.

It is a bit of a faff, isn't it,
really?

I mean...

Well, let's see
if it is worth it, shall we?

I like the nice tart
flavour of the raspberries.

And you've got a little
hint of lemon in there, as well.

The cake is a little bit hefty.

That's got a lovely
swirl in that one. Thank you.

I like the fact that the sponge is
a little thicker because it

means it's risen more and the fresh
strawberries are just delicious.

They're giraffe-patterned,
giraffe-esque.

And, er, we could
even go as far to say

the caramel drips are, you know,
like the sea lion bit.

Water.

Not the best-looking
mini rolls I've seen.

There was obviously a rush.

The cream and the caramel's run out
because it's been warm

when you've done it. Then, your
flavours are all wrong.

It's down to the timing.

And I bet you did better
when you were practising.

Yeah, but tent pressure, isn't it?

Goodness, Giuseppe,
that looks as neat as a pin.

Absolutely beautiful.

You've come up with something
that's very elegant.

Cuts lovely.

Classic, lovely swirl inside there.

Perfect swirl.
That is a perfect swirl.

Classic almond cake with orange.

Yeah. Ah, it's my favourite kind
of cake. Oh, good.

It's delicate and it's so well
balanced that it grows on you.

With every mouthful, it's getting
better and better.

I think your flavours are beautiful.

The orange blossom comes through
and it's very delicate,

but it's enough there to create
a great flavour, because ricotta

carries a little bit of flavour,
so that between the two,

it's perfect. It's a triumph.
Well done.

Oh, good. Thank you,
Giuseppe. Thank you.

WHISPERS: Well done. Amazing. They
look fantastic.

Let me recap -

a triumph, neat as a pin.
Perfect.

The only problem there is, there is
only one way from here.

Paul made me eat my own cake
and judge it.

Uh, crazy, crazy.

They said they looked terrible.

Everyone knew that, anyway.

The seepage was massive.

Each week, the bakers'
second challenge will be a mystery

shrouded in gingham.

It's time for your first-ever
technical challenge,

which has been set for you
by the delightful Prue Leith.

Prue, any words of advice?

This is a really old-fashioned
recipe.

And those of you who are under 35
may never have heard of it.

Don't panic, just read the recipe.

As ever, this technical
challenge will be judged blind.

So we're going to have to ask these
two poppets to leave the tent.

Bye-bye.

So, for your first-ever technical
challenge, Prue would like you

to make that tea-time classic -
the malt loaf.

Served with home-made
butter on the side.

It should be rich and moist.
Like Paul Hollywood.

You have two hours, which doesn't
seem nearly enough, does it?

On your marks. Get set.

Bake!

Malt loaf is my absolute favourite.
Love it.

Never made it, though.

Damn! I wish I'd made it.

In the technical challenge,
the bakers are all given

identical ingredients
and the same pared-down recipe.

Because Prue said under-35s won't
know what it is,

but, of course, all the under-35s
said, "Do you know what it is,
Maggie?"

Of course. Yes, I do.
I'm over 35 -

well over 35, so, in theory,
I should know what this looks like.

In reality, I haven't got
the faintest clue.

I've never had... Er, what is it
called?

Mal.. Malt loaf.

So it's our first technical
challenge and you've set them

a malt loaf. It's sticky, rich.

Nobody doesn't like a malt loaf.

Where can they go wrong?

Because it's just a simple mix,
it's a little bit easy to undermix

and so just take trouble to make
sure that you haven't got any

lumps of flour left in there.

And under-bake it and it's likely
to sink in the middle.

And overbaked, it's just too hard
and dry.

That's perfect.

Nicely distributed fruit.

Beautiful dark colour.

We just need some butter on it.
Have you got enough there, Prue?

No.

It's gorgeous, isn't it?
It reminds me of my nan.

When I was a kid going round there,

given a little piece of malt loaf
with butter on it.

Oh! Judging them is going to be
hard, though.

I can't talk, I've got a mouth
full of malt loaf.

PRUE MUMBLES

Feeling quite excited.

My wife asked me
to make a tea loaf years ago,

and I never did.

So here I am.

"Tip the raisins and chopped
prunes into a microwave-safe bowl."

I'm just cutting the prunes now.
I hate prunes. Ugh.

If the bakers leave
the fruit in large chunks...

I think if these are the same size
as the raisins, it will probably

be quite good.

..it could sink to the
bottom of their malt loaf.

There's a bit of guesswork here.

Just re-chopping them, cos clearly

they're not finely done enough.

Are these the sort of ingredients
you would bake with in Italy?

Er, no.
I love prunes, but on their own.

I've never put them in a cake.

Well, they,
they keep you busy, you see.

It does, it does.

I don't think I've ever actually
seen malt extract before.

Black treacle, 40g.

Another ingredient I've never
used in my life.

Oh, it doesn't want to come off!

This is a joke.

Hey!

Malt loaf? Gross.

Don't like it? I just don't
really like any of the smells.

I think when you present it to Paul,

just hold his mouth open

and drop in chunks. Like you're
rearing a sort of small...

So you don't want me to...
..ostrich...

I don't like ostriches.
..that's fallen out of a nest.

You don't like ostriches? No.
Or malt loaf?

An ostrich ran away with me on it.
With you on it?

As a child. You got on an
ostrich? Yes.

So, we were in a ostrich farm. Was
there any? It had a bag on its head.

A bag? So it was clearly unhinged.
This is a dream surely.

An unhinged ostrich. There's an
ostrich with a bag on its head.

This ostrich went... waaagh!

Went crazy? Crazy.

Started to like run off.
And the ostrich is running round

the pen with me on it screaming.
Wow.

Horrendous. Traumatised.

This sounds like the best day ever.

Does it?

"Combine the remaining ingredients
to form the cake batter."

If the bakers under-mix the
batter...

Just going all in.
Give it a good stir.

..lumps of inedible flour will be
left after baking.

It's not overly mixed,
but it's a nice gooey texture.

Fingers crossed it'll come out OK.

But over-mixing will create gluten,

leading to a tough, chewy loaf.

This doesn't look very
promising now, does it?

How can this be baked into a cake?

Pff.

You can live off malt loaf,
apparently. Can you really? Yes.

Don't look that up.

It's going in now.

Oh, that is a lot for this little
cake tin, isn't it?

I might actually take
a small amount out.

I hope I've made the right choice.

Wish me luck.

And they don't tell you how long
to cook things for. Cheeky.

I ain't got an idea how long
I've got to bake this for.

It's dark, so how would you know
if it's overbaked?

I suspect that it's quite
a long bake.

I'm putting it in for 45 minutes.

I was going to say 40 minutes,
but that maybe is a bit... No,

I don't think that's bold.

An hour to start with
and then check after an hour.

Well, let's see.

"Cut orange peel
and ginger into matchsticks."

"Add the sugar and water to the pan,
bring to a boil

"until the peel is translu...

"trans-ulent... tran-solent
and s... and soft."

Kind of like see-throughy.

I've got a question to ask you.
Go ahead.

Do people tell you that you
look like someone?

Um... Well, who do you think I look
like? Well, somebody...

I said a young Robert De Niro.

What?! I'll take that.

Someone else said a young
Andy Garcia. OK.

Someone else said a young
Peter Andre.

Nah, no way. Not that one. No? Not
taking that? Not taking that one.

No offence, Peter, by the way,
if you're watching.

He's not watching.
He's in the gym.

Bakers, you have four minutes plus
six minutes plus six minutes

plus four minutes plus four
minutes

plus six minutes. Lovely.
Clear as mud.

Oh, 30 minutes.

Still looks really wet in
the middle, but I think that's
the point.

I think that's cos it's
supposed to take ages.

No. Needs loads of time, still.

It's very gooey.

I'll give it more time.
Another 15.

And I want to get the butter going.

Instructions just says to
make the butter.

Because we make butter
all the time, don't we?

I'm weighing out my double cream,

so I'm going to chuck
that into a stand mixer,

whisk it up and, if you over-whisk
it,

it'll then eventually form butter.

Right, beat.

Oh, my God, that's going in my eye!

I've just got to, like, squeeze it.

Quite therapeutic, actually.

I'm just hoping, when I open this
muslin, that it resembles butter.

It looks like it.

It smells like it.

That's butter.
"Chill." Sounds good.

Bakers, you've got ten minutes left.
Ow, my ears, you've burst them.

SORRY! That's better.

See if it's ready.

I might just give it a few
more minutes.

This is nerve-racking, isn't it?

SHE SIGHS
I dunno. Painful.

TIMER BLEEPS
Right.

Looking all right?

Probably five more minutes.

SHE SIGHS

No, I'll maybe leave it
a little bit more.

Will I? Unsure.

Still got a real bad wobble.

I reckon that's done.

OK that's it. It's coming out.

The cake is on the move, people.

It looks fine.

Scrumptious!

So I think it's just right.

Either it's done or it'll
have to do.

Agh!

This is this really dense cake.

Come out totally clear.

Not totally clear.

Mine looks a bit doughy, innit?

Bakers, you have one minute left.

My God.

Just letting it glaze up.

Can't have a dry bottom.
Oh, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.

I've got to somehow get
attractive orange on top.

Just need to put the butter on.

What a shebang. Honestly.

This is a nightmare.

It's really quite pretty.

Bakers, your time is up.

If malt loaf is supposed to have a
split in it, then it's perfect.

I hope it's not raw in the middle.

Well, you know, I just don't know.

Who knows? And who knows?
Who knows? They could cut into it

and say that's overbaked.
It looks fantastic.

I hope it's worked out, this time.

Please bring your malt loafs
down to the gingham table

and place them behind
your photograph.

Off you go. I don't want
to crash into anybody.

I'm coming.

Where's my ugly mug?

Oh, I'm first. What a nightmare.

Oh, your peel looks really nice.

Look at mine, mine's still wet.

I need the toilet.

Prue and Paul are expecting
deliciously rich

and moist malt loafs, served
with freshly made salted butter -

and they'll have no idea
whose is whose.

Right, let's start.

The crystallisation on this
looks pretty good.

They're nice and even, aren't they?

Distribution's good.
Yeah, no, that looks lovely.

Yeah, feels good.

The butter's nice. There you go.
Yeah.

That's so delicious.

It's sticky and it's got that
characteristic chew.

Hmm. And it's well balanced
with the fruit, as well.

Now, this one looks very small.

Let's have a look inside.

It's probably going to be
a bit tough, I think.

The fruit distribution is there.

It's just a bit bread-like.
Hmm.

This one has beautiful
topping on it. Yeah.

It's not very evenly distributed,
is it? No, it's not.

It's in lumps.

There's almost too much fruit
and not too much of the malt loaf.

I quite like this.
I do, too.

That's got a nice
distribution inside.

Hmm, this butter's not too salty.

It's got a little bit of
a chew to that one.

That's lovely.

Moving on to number five.

It's got a good height.
It's not too domed.

That's got a good texture,

got that little bit of tension
in it, as well, which I like.

Moving on.
Quite a strong colour on there.

Lots of fruit. Yeah.

That's very short.

I think that's probably
been slightly over baked.

It's quite a pale colour.

But I think it's properly cooked.

There's a bit of flour not
quite distributed evenly. Hmm.

Got a nice chewy edge to it.

It's sort of there, it nearly is.

This has got a lot of candy peel
on the top. I like that.

I like that look. I like that, too.

Hmm, nice colour.

Nice bit of tension in that one.

That's excellent.

It's got lots of fruit,
it's got a malty taste,

it's got a lovely tension.
Very good.

Nice colour all the way round.

The flavour's good.

But on the second bite,
it feels quite bready again.

OK.

This looks a bit small.

And it's a little doughy there.

That's raw. You can tell by
the colour how light it is.

Hmm. I think it's
slightly underdone.

Definitely.

Quite pale, but decent.

I like that look.

Good blend of fruit.

Probably needed longer in the oven,

because it's sticking to
every bit of my mouth.

We'll have to take your teeth out
and clean them later.

God, she slapped him...

OK. It's quite a strong colour,
which I like.

Lots of little flour pockets.

Whoever did this,
you need to mix it more evenly.

Prue and Paul will now rank the malt
loafs from the worst to the best.

In 12th spot, we have...

..this one.

Amanda, there's loads and loads
of flour pockets in there.

In 11th place, we have this one.

Chigs, it was under baked
and squishy.

In tenth spot, we have this one.

Not sure, Giuseppe, what happened
with the fruit distribution,

but they're all in clumps.

Jairzeno is ninth, Crystelle eighth,

seventh Rochica, Jurgen is sixth,

Tom is fifth, Lizzie is fourth,

and George is third.

In second, we have...

..this one.

Me.

Freya, that's a nice loaf.

Ah, thank you. And the only
reason why you're not in first

is because number one was better.

And that means that this
is number one.

Yay! Woo!

Well done, Maggie.

It's a beautiful loaf.

I won't say you're anything
like as old as me,

but you're getting a little bit
older than some of these,

and you can make the perfect
malt loaf. Well done.

Thank you very much.

When they went down the numbers,

I kept thinking,
they've just missed me out.

And then it went down and down,
and then there I was!

You know what I'm going to do now...

So, yes, I'm terribly...
I'm terribly pleased.

Really pleased.

I thought it was quite ironic
that she was saying that

this is like a challenge for old
people, and I was the youngest,

so that was quite exciting.

Not great. I don't think that one
went that well.

I'm gonna throw all the flour
out of my house when I get home.

I'm never gonna bake
with flour again.

Just one challenge remains before
we crown this year's

first Star Baker and reveal who
will have to leave the tent.

Well, kids, another day,
another bubble.

Here we are.

We're back in the bubble.

I do think we've settled
in pretty easy.

Overall, I've been really
impressed with the bakers.

The only person that's in a little
bit of trouble would be Amanda.

She has to have a good day today.
Yeah.

Tom didn't have a good Signature.

George likewise,
a terrible Signature.

I think, up at the top, Giuseppe has
to be with that Signature

cos it was so good.
Jurgen's done really well.

And actually I think Maggie...
Sorry, Prue. Maggie.

Maggie slash Prue. Yeah.

Is this going to be a running
joke for ten weeks? Yes, yes, yes.

Absolutely.
Sorry Maggie. Prue.

I'm beginning to hope Maggie goes
out just to get rid of this joke.

Good luck, everybody.

Good morning, bakers.

Welcome back to the tent.

Are you excited for your
first-ever Showstopper?

ALL: Yes.

I can't hear you are you excited
for your first-ever Showstopper?

ALL: Yes.

No, I can't hear you,
I've got a inner ear infection.

It's actually quite painful.

Now, today, Prue and Paul would love
you to make an awe-inspiring

anti-gravity illusion cake.

Your vertically sculpted cakes

must appear to defy gravity

and should be decorated in a way

that represents a precious memory.

You've got four hours
to defy gravity.

On your marks. Get set.

Bake.

I've got something to prove
after the Signature yesterday.

And I really want this to go well.

I'm rocking and rolling.
There's no room for error today.

The whole point of an anti-gravity
cake is a top-heavy cake

that looks like it's falling or
cascading

so they've really got to
think of the framework

to build the anti-gravity
cake on to.

We want to look at these cakes
and think, "How did they do that?"

"How can that still be standing"

But as always, it has
to be a delicious cake.

And it mustn't be
style over substance

so, as usual, it's difficult.

Morning, Chigs. Morning.
Hello. How are you all?

Right, good. Tell us
all about your anti-gravity cake.

My anti-gravity cake is called
Where It All Began.

As you probably already know,

I've only been baking for a short
period of time. Check him out.

And he's on Bake Off already.

That just goes to show it's
not that difficult, kids. No.

Not that difficult.
Well, we'll see.

We'll see, yeah we'll see.

Chigs is attempting a baking scene

where a gravity-defying jug
will pour chocolate into a bowl

made from delicate chocolate
sponge with peanut butter

and chocolate buttercream.

The jug is actually
cake as well, isn't it?

It's got cake in it.

And how is it all
going to be, elevated?

Um...

With magic.

Also relying on a sprinkling
of magic is Giuseppe.

My anti-gravity cake is going to be
Jack and Beanstalk

cos it's a story that I
read to the kids at night.

A fondant beanstalk will hold his
cloud-shaped chocolate cake aloft

in a spectacular fairy tale scene
dedicated to his three young boys.

They don't know I'm here just
yet and I was practising

this last week. Oh, really?

Yeah, and my eldest went, "Papa,
this cake is really good you know."

It would look good even on
Bake Off and I'm like,

"Yeah, hold on to that thought."
Oh, I love it.

Oh, my God, that's amazing. Yeah.
When are you going to tell 'em?

Well, I'd like... I'd like...
Not at all? No, not at all.

And then just go, "Hey,
shall we watch this?"

Yeah, "Look, look what's on TV."

Oh, I want to be there
when that happens. Well, I...

That's the best thing ever.

Giuseppe's not the only baker

inspired by a little bedtime
reading.

I'm making a lamp and a book.

The first book I read in
English from cover to cover.

What book? Thomas More's Utopia.

Light reading.

Orange chiffon sponge,
a honey buttercream with rose

and a pistachio praline
will form his weighty tome

and his precisely engineered
childhood bedside lamp.

I'm using spanners, yes.

They have been
through the dishwasher.

I'm a bit of a DIY person.

Avoiding collapse won't be easy.

It is a very difficult one
cos you want a stable cake

but you want a tasty cake.

A delicate sponge could fall
apart as it tries to defy

the pull of gravity.

Hopefully the cake
will be like clouds.

But any denser
and it won't be pleasant to eat.

It's quite a thick batter
so there is some density to it.

Forgotten how many eggs I put in.

One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

No. One, two...

I keep losing count.

If he can get his measurements
right,

George's sponges will become a
backgammon board

and suspended coffee
cup in mid-flow.

When I'm on holiday in Cyprus,

when you walk through the villages,

you see little Greek old
men playing backgammon.

How are you going to
hold up the coffee pot?

Well, I've built a little platform

where the coffee pot will sit
and then the coffee

will pour down the threaded rod.
Yeah. I just hope it stands.

Fingers crossed.
So, do we. So, do we.

Rather than sunny Cyprus,

Maggie is off on a staycation.

I come from a beachy area and
I'm making an ice cream cornet.

Oh, lovely. When you go to the
beach,

what ice cream do you like best?

A mint choc chip.
Are you doing mint choc chip?

Oh, no. Oh, no. No?
No, no, no, no.

Why would you eat toothpaste
in an ice cream?

Oh, controversial!

Maggie will recreate her favourite
raspberry ripple ice cream,

complete with a suspended
bag of sprinkles

which she hopes will
impress Paul and Prue.

You've missed my ears.

Hello, Prue, how you doing?
You all right?

How are things going today,
Prue? Are you all right?

Is it weird being here?

Thank you, Maggie.

That wasn't my idea.
Or yours I dare say.

No, I know,
he's so naughty.

Shoo.

You're just trying to
make me squash my raspberries.

Good luck in there.

Unless they get their cakes
baked as soon as possible...

Please be good to me.

..the bakers won't have enough
time to pull off their

gravity-defying constructions.

And the more sponges
they need to stack and carve...

Loads of cake. Loads of cake.

..the more complicated
the engineering becomes.

The lamp part, I've put
white fondant there

and then I'll put this on top,

and then I'll build the cake up.

So it's going to be
six layers of cake,

all stacked on top of each other

and then sort of V-shaped bouquet
of flowers with all the stems.

It's a bit of a monster.

On top of moulded
puffed rice and marshmallow,

Crystelle will stack cinnamon
sponges with Italian meringue,

buttercream and roasted pecans.

All decorated to look
like a bouquet of flowers.

So I'm dedicating it to my auntie.

She actually used to do a lot
of flower arranging back in the day.

And also she used to bake a lot.

So I thought, if I go out in week
one,

I want to dedicate at least one
bake to her.

So it's not an anti-gravity cake
it's auntie gravity cake.

Oh, nice one. Clever.
See you later, guys.

Flowers are, like, my favourite
thing. My mum loves flowers as well.

So it's kind of just, like,
the perfect theme really.

Freya's all-vegan floral scene

will feature chocolate sponges

filled with a kirsch cream

and cherry jam

all decorated with dozens of
hand-piped buttercream flowers.

Honestly, when I first made
this chocolate cake,

I thought it was the best
chocolate cake that I'd had.

I don't think that you'd know it was
vegan.

But I'd eat cake off the floor so...

I feel I'm probably not
the best judge of that, really.

Bakers, you are halfway through
your anti-gravity challenge.

Ooh.

Let's get this baby out.

Yeah, they're done.
That's beautiful.

All they have to do is cool down.

Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.

With the last of their
sponges out of the oven...

Oh, that'll do.
That'll do. I'm happy with that.

..the bakers need to use every
minute to perfect

their decorative elements.

I just want to let my cakes chill
for as long as possible,

which is why I'm just doing
all my decoration now.

So, this is my sweetie bag.

Let's see if we can a dolphin.

My cake is going to look
like a wave hitting a rock

and I'm going to have a couple
of little dolphins coming out of it.

Inspired by a trip to Florida,

Amanda's dolphins will emerge
from a towering wave

of lemon and elderflower sponge.

You need a good day
today, don't you?

I do need a good day today, yes.
Have you practised it?

I've made about four of these.

Course she has.
And they didn't collapse?

Um, one of them did collapse.

The next two were perfect.

Never say that the practice went
weird to these two.

The first one collapsed.
The others didn't collapse.

I'm just going to start building.

To defy gravity, most of the bakers
will have to carefully layer

delicate sponge and filling

onto precarious, custom-made
structures.

This is all exciting now.

I feel sick.

But Jairzeno plans to
take an even bigger risk.

I'm going to cut the sponge
and roll it up like a cylinder.

He'll attempt to stack guava,
lime and chilli Swiss rolls

with a suspended paint can

pouring technicolour
shards of chocolate

to celebrate his passion
for colourful bakes.

It should be steady enough yes.

And the buttercream will have, will
kind of reinforce it - like cement.

It won't taste like cement.

With every additional
layer of sponge and filling...

I have to thread the screws
all the way down.

..the Showstoppers get heavier...

Oh. I just want to get as much
flavour in here as possible.

..and defying gravity
gets harder and harder.

But Jairzeno has
yet to leave the ground.

I am struggling now.

I think the buttercream
is a bit too soft.

Right, this isn't quite...

Oops.

No, no, no, no, no.

Oh. BLEEP.

Bakers, you have one hour left
for your anti-gravity illusion cake.

Jairzeno's showstopper doesn't look
like it'll defy gravity

any time soon.

Right.

I'll put the thing in the fridge to
chill cos I'm trying to get

the main cake to stand up.

And he's not the only one
struggling.

Oh, OK it's completely
split down the middle.

And the bottom layer has broken.

Rochica will have to repair a giant
apple made from a caramel

and spiced apple sponge to be able
to hang it from a puffed rice

and marshmallow tree,
inspired by her uncle's garden.

It's really fragile
so I'm gonna ice it

and then just get it in the freezer.

Oh, I'm so stressed out.
It's all right.

Just, you know...
Breathe. You'll be fine.

My dad told me to... breathe in.
Ahh!

Actually I feel a bit better,
breathing in and out.

Did it feel better? Yeah.

Your dad knows. He's got some
skills. My parents are so wisdomous.

Wisdomous!

Is that a word? That's a new word.
Wisdomous.

Lizzie has also had
the benefit of some fatherly wisdom.

What are you using to build it?

Me Dad's gone a bit crazy with
the superglue and a chopping board.

Her dad, Andy, had built the base
for a cake jug that will pour

cream into a peach
and vanilla bowl-shaped cake

in honour of their Nana's
tinned peaches and cream puddings.

And have you practised it
with this armature? Yeah.

And it worked?

It was horrific!
THEY LAUGH

So, you can tell it's, like,
leaning.

You've really thrown your own dad
under the bus here.

Well, I've got to throw someone
under -

as long as it's not me, isn't it?

This is the jug.

Most of the bakers still have to
complete smaller, even more

fragile cakes to suspend.

The lamp is nearing completion.

Stressful, man.

This is gonna be a coffee
pot that will sit here.

It's a hazardous process...

It's like a jug pouring cake
batter into a big bowl,

with splashes coming out of it.

..that Tom has chosen to avoid.

So, I'm actually just using
dowels for my cakes.

You know we want an anti-gravity
cake? Yes.

Do you think it qualifies?
I'm hoping it's enough.

It does lean quite significantly.

Tom plans to use lemon
and almond sponges to construct

a teetering triple-tiered concert
hall, to celebrate his love

of classical music, complete with
cannon for the 1812 Overture.

We must look at it and think, "My
goodness! How does that stand up?

OK, OK.

I'll see what I can do. I mean it's
a bit late in the day, innit, now.

That's the problem with that, isn't
it? I've designed it!

Good luck, Tom.

Bakers, you have half an hour left.

Oh, my god.

I don't think I'll be able to
decorate it.

There won't be a paint pot at the
top with the colours falling out.

no.

Because it's not even standing up.

Whilst Jairzeno has been forced to
abandon his plans...

That's perfect.

..the rest of the bakers face
the nerve-wracking task

of seeing theirs through.

Oh, this is a bit stressful,
isn't it?

God, it is so silent in here.

I do like painting.

I'm not sure I like it
so much at the moment.

I'm horrendous at doing any
finishes.

Paul's gonna love you.

Don't look into his eyes, right?

I'm going to stare him down.

Don't stare Paul down!

You will not win that battle.

If it falls, then it can be
a fallen apple.

So now I'm going to put...

..that there.

Stay there.

Slipping a bit.

This looks as
though I'm doing nothing,

but I'm waiting for the white
chocolate to set and I can't move.

Oh, hell.

Mine is wobbling so bad.

I think this has taken, like,
a year off my life.

So, this is just having
something to present.

Hopefully it'll stand up.

I'm so scared it's gonna fall.

Ah. Ooh! Ha-ha!

I think I'm done, you know.

In the show? Yeah.

My God, I can't breathe.

Ooh.

How much time do we have left?

One minute left.

Come on, man.

Chigs, do you think you can help me
move it up onto there?

The book needs pages.

I don't know if it'll fall off, to
be honest. Don't say that.

Dearie me.

Wonder if I can spell
"Sorry" in cannonballs?

Eh!

Are we on?

Let's put it flat and then slide.

Slide. Oh, what a breeze.

I usually quite like improvising.
Not so much today!

Bakers, your time is up!

Step away from your bakes.

Gladly!

Well done, Jurgen. Well done, my
friend. Thank you.

George, how you feeling?

I completely rushed it.

Oh, have you seen some of mine?
Gorgeous.

Giuseppe, it looks a ten out of ten.

Giuseppe, you've got some
skill, dude man. Thank you.

It's judgement time for the
anti-gravity illusion cakes.

Chigs, would you like to
bring your cake up here?

Matt, could you help me, please?

Yeah, I'll give you a hand.
CHIGS LAUGHS

Right, you ready? Yeah.

To me. To you.

To me. To you.
To me. To you.

Just cupping the cup.

There you go. It's going to break.

It's going to break.

Right, I'm going to step back now.

GROANING

Well, it was anti-gravity before
but I don't know what it is now!

When I say anti-gravity...

Well, it's not much any more.

But I like the bowl.

It's got a bit of movement in it,
which I quite like.

So it's chocolate fudge? Yes.

PRUE: The layers are good.

It's got a chocolate and
peanut butter buttercream

around it as well.

PRUE: I think it's delicious.
Yes. I also like the texture.

Beautifully moist.

The sponge is delicious,

and so is the peanut butter
buttercream as well.

You're a very good baker.

Maybe your engineering skills
need honing a little.

PRUE: It could be neater.

I agree. I'm sure you can paint
better than that.

I can certainly paint better than
that, absolutely.

PAUL: Let's have a look.

I think you've got some nice
flavours.

But you need to concentrate
more on the finesse.

Yeah.

I feel it looks more like a plant
pot than an ice cream.

It's gone from a cornet to a tub.

Your Victoria sandwich is delicious.

Thank you. But there is not much
flavour in there.

I was expecting something very
different to this.

Yeah, I was expecting something
very different to that.

It's quite mortifying, actually.

I think the sponge is perfect.

I love the flavour.

It tastes like guava.
I love it.

All the elements to it are there,
but there's nothing else.

PRUE: Love the little dolphins,
and I think it's beautifully done.

You've certainly got
the gravity-defying bit.

I'm not totally convinced it does

because that's just the Rice Krispie
bit, isn't it? Yeah.

But I love the colour of it
and the concept of it.

This is lemon drizzle?

Yeah, lemon and elderflower.

I think your sponges are slightly
overbaked.

They're a little bit too dry.

Did you use an extract with that
one?

I used elderflower liqueur.
There's quite a lot in there.

I think there's a touch too much.
It's quite...

It burns, doesn't it? ..powerful.
Yeah.

Thank you very much.
Thank you.

WHISPERS: Well done. Thank you.
It stayed up. It stayed up.

Lizzie, would you like to bring
up your Showstopper, please?

GASPS

Oh, no!

Whoops. Oh, my God.

God! Sorry!

NOEL: Paul's slowly sabotaged you.

It's a bit simplistic.

But it does defy gravity.

But the side of it is a real mess,
isn't it?

It may taste fantastic yet.

Best hope so.

I could happily eat a bowl of that.

Cool.

I think your flavour's nice -
just neaten up your work a little

bit more.

I think those flowers look
incredible.

Thank you. You've spent some time on
that.

It's chocolate sponge,
kirsch buttercream

and then a little
bit of cherry jam as well.

Hm. I think that's lovely.
Ah, awesome.

It's very boozy.
PAUL: I think it's delicious.

I think you have got a nice
chocolaty flavour there.

Nice kick from the alcohol as well.

You've got some beautiful textures
running through there.

And it's vegan. Yeah.
I think you've done a great job.

Oh, thank you so much.
A really, really good job.

I really appreciate it.

PAUL: It's very elegant.

Think the pipework is beautifully
done. I think between you

and Freya you've done an amazing
job with these flowers.

PRUE: And you've certainly hit the
gravity-defying, because you cannot

believe that such a heavy cake is
not going to fall over.

And just remind us
about what the cake is.

It's a cinnamon sponge with
a vanilla Italian meringue

buttercream and roasted pecans.

Hm. Looks good.

PAUL CHUCKLES

I got exactly that,
exactly as you said it. Oh!

It's absolutely beautifully
flavoured. Lovely.

The cinnamon hit is very powerful,
but it works

because you've balanced that out
with the vanilla as well.

And then the nuts just leave that
little bit of texture as well.

So I think you've created something
that is actually quite remarkable.

I absolutely agree. Thank you so
much. That was amazing. Well done.

Well done.
It really is lovely.

He doesn't say remarkable very
often,

unless he's talking about himself.
LAUGHTER

Aw, well done.

Well done.

You've definitely got
the excitement in there.

You probably could've done with
a little bit more detail.

Look at that -
apple and caramel, how lovely.

Oh, your flavours are lovely.

Thank you. The anti-gravity
is certainly there.

It needs to be a little bit
more honed. Yeah.

I have to say,

I'm a bit disappointed about the
gravity-defying bit.

It was a bit of a disaster
to be honest.

It's a, uh, lemon and almond cake.

It's rather more almond than lemon.
Yeah.

And although there is a little
bit of a lean, there's no way

that's defying gravity.

Fair enough.

It's simply beautiful.

And it's certainly gravity-defying,
especially as you've got the cloud

off-centre, so that really makes you
feel this should fall over.

PAUL: It's a great kid's cake, that.

Let's have a look, shall we?

The inside of the cake
is XXX-inspired sponge

with a raspberry jam
and cream cheese buttercream.

The sponge is a little dry.

OK.

Good flavour, though - really good.

Flavour's superb.

Because of the size of the cake,
I would've put two layers in there.

Right. OK. It's true. If you'd
had three layers of the sponge

and a bit more filling, you wouldn't
have noticed the dryness so much.

It's a pity, because you've
absolutely nailed the illusion bit.

I think it's so elegant, don't you?
Yeah.

It's so clean and simple
but beautifully done.

Is there cake in this?
Yes.

There is? So this has got a rod
support, and then you've... Yes.

With the plinth,
and you've put the cake onto that.

Uh, yes, and I've got two more
supporting discs inside.

It's well-engineered.

The cake is an orange chiffon sponge
with honey buttercream with

a hint of rose
and pistachio praline.

I'm glad you said hint, because rose
can be so strong. Yes.

You've got the rose
absolutely right.

You can hardly taste it
but it's there. Yeah.

It's beautiful because the chiffon's
quite a light sponge, then you've

got texture coming from the nuts,
which gives you a beautiful flavour.

And then the background, you've got
this rose sort of floating

through, so technically the way
you've baked it is perfect.

You could become the flavour king.

Very, very good.
Thank you very much.

Well done. Well done, yeah, so good.

Smashed it. Smashed it.

Phew.

Still sinking in.

I can't believe it.

I'm a very happy Jurgen indeed.

I really thought my cake was raw.

And they cut it and I was like
"Oh, my God, it's raw."

And it wasn't!

Oh, blimey. I think it's the worst
bake I've ever done.

That's pretty bad.

To be honest, I expect to go home

because it doesn't even have an
anti-gravity element.

I just think week one's nerves have
just got the better of me.

I hope I don't go, but I think
I might be, you know, going home.

I absolutely want to stay -
of course I want to stay.

What a great bunch of people.

I've never been able to sit
and talk to

someone in detail about a cake
and not bore the pants off them!

Prue and Paul have
made their decision.

I don't want to get emotional.

No, come on.

Well done, bakers.

Luckily, I've got the amazing job
of announcing the first Star Baker.

And the Star Baker this
week...

..is...

..Jurgen.

Well, I have a job that no-one
wants, and it's a real shame because

we've only just met and we're
already losing one of the gang.

I'm sorry to say that the first
person to be leaving us is...

..Tom.

Absolutely, that's fair enough.

Did not go to plan at all!

Oh, dear.

Hey. Thank you very much.

I always have been harder on myself
than I really should be,

but I definitely am proud of myself,
and I never say that.

So that must mean quite a bit.

But I'm mostly going to miss
spending time with all the lovely

other bakers, to be honest.

They're really talented
and absolutely lovely people,

so I'm so going to miss hanging out
with them every day.

You see, you can do it, can't you?
Thank you. Thank you so much.

I was absolutely thinking
I was going to go first.

But I'm really sad for Tom.
He's such a gentleman.

I love him,
he's so... such a nice man.

George, lift it up a bit.

I'm in shock.

I'm just so pleased that the judges
have seen something in my baking

and I'm here for another week.

Well done, Jurgen.
Well done, Jurgen.

Fantastic. Thank you, thank you
very much. So good.

Thank you. Really, really good.
Thank you.

It is incredible.

It is incredible. Uh,
before, I thought, "Star Baker, hm,

"doesn't matter too much,"
but I feel so... Woo!

Well done! I'm so excited, yes.

LINE RINGS

Nobody at home.

Next time...

Good luck, my little pretties.

..it's biscuit week.

I'm sure talking to them helps.

With a delicate signature...
Oh!

..that could see the bakers snap.

This is killing me.

A deliciously nostalgic Technical...

Who makes biscuits that you can
buy in the shop?

Why?!
Get a tub for 11p, can't you?

..and show-stopping...
Oh, no.

..interactive...

ALL: Oh!
..all-biscuit toys.

If it collapses, it collapses.

Ah!

Please don't fall.

Oh!
Oh.

Oh, no!

For Biscuit Week, the bakers take on filled brandy snaps for the signature. They produce a jammy childhood favourite in the Technical and finally put their engineering skills to the test to create an interactive toy made exclusive...
[birds chirping]

[Matt] You excited for biscuit week?

Of course I'm excited.
I mean, I'm a biscuit. I'm over the moon.

Mmm, yeah.

Hey, who's that fella over there?
He looks familiar.

-[Matt] Oh.
-[Noel] Off the telly.

Yeah, he's quite dishy in real life.

Lovely blue eyes.

Eh, what's he looking at us like that for?

-[Matt] Ooh.
-[Noel] All salivating.

He's getting a bit close, isn't he?



[Matt] Ooh, what's going on?

[screaming]

Oh, I suppose I'll have to introduce
the show on me own now.

Welcome to The Great Britishâ¦

[screaming]

Advertise your product or brand here

[Noel] This time it's biscuit week.

Good luck, my little pretties.

[Noel] With a scorching signatureâ¦

Ow, ow, ow, ow.

â¦that's tight on time.

[Lizzie] They're not bubbling
and I'm panicking about it.

I'm never making brandy snaps again.

[Noel] A troublesome technicalâ¦



They're so soft I can't get it out.
It's like mashed potatoes.

-â¦that's hard to handle.
-Why?

[exclaims]

Oh, my God. What's wrong with you?

Don't panic.

[Noel] And a Showstopper
that sees the bakers

build childhood toys
out of delicate biscuit.

Oh, God, it's gonna fall.

[Noel] Causing tantrums in the tent.

[Amanda screams]

Oh, it collapsed.

What do they do with horses
that have broken legs?

Shoot 'em. [chuckles]

[opening theme music playing]

[indistinct chatter]

[Giuseppe] Week two, ready to go.

I'm feeling strangely confident today

which could be a good signâ¦
[chuckling] or the beginning of the end.

[Jairzeno] I'm not pleased
with how the first week went.

It was just bad time management.

Hopefully, today it'll be nice and smooth.

-It'll be polished.
-[Rochica] Good luck, guys.

Biscuit week.
It's exciting. It's also terrifying.

Biscuits are hard.
Sneaky little blighters.

[Amanda] I bake biscuits at home.
They normally take me three days,

so not gonna
get away with that here. [chuckles]

Good morning, bakers.
Welcome back to the tent for biscuit week.

Oh, my God, I love biscuits.
I once ate 119 biscuits.

-What, in one sitting?
-No, sporadically over 14 years.

[all laughing]

[Matt] For your signature challenge,

the judges would like you
to bake a batch of 24 brandy snaps.

The judges are looking
for perfectly baked lace biscuits.

Have to be identical,
have to have a good snap.

Your snaps can be any shape
but should be coated, dipped or filled.

You have two hours.

On your marks.

-Get set.
-Bake.

Got me fast shoes on today,
so moving like the speed of light.

I'm feeling calm.
Just anything can happen, right?

Brandy snaps,
they're not the easiest thing to make.

[Maggie] Who can't make
a crispy identical lace biscuit?

Yes, easy peasy.

[Prue] I make brandy snaps quite often,

but they never last in my house
because they are just so delicious.

What I'd like to see
is 24 identical, perfect brandy snaps.

But lots of things can go wrong.

This is all about batch baking.

The key thing
is to get your brandy snap quite lacy.

You want those holes in there to create
that traditional brandy snap look.

It's all about textures for me.

It's about a crispy brandy snap
and a beautifully soft interior.

Whatever filling they choose,
there's going to be a danger

of the moisture in the filling
sogging up the biscuit.

It's not a brandy snap if it doesn't snap.

-[Paul] Hello, Lizzie.
-Hello.

So, Lizzie, brandy snaps.
Tell us about them.

So my brandy snaps are based on
my favourite fast food chain apple pie.

It's piping hot,
could burn your mouth, like, to the sun.

Has it been deep fried by any chance?

Yes, it has.

-Ermâ¦ [chuckles]
-We know what you mean.

And my dog likes a little, er, kids meal.

[Lizzie] Come on, Prue.

[Noel] Lizzie's terrier Prue
is no ordinary pooch.

A social media star,

she's even acquired a taste
for eating out.

[Lizzie] Oh, Prue.

[Noel] Lizzie's
fast food-inspired brandy snaps

will be filled with vanilla crÃ¨me diplomat

and topped with apples
caramelised in calvados.

Yesterday,
were you in the tent practising these?

-Ermâ¦ [sighs]
-Oh.

-[Lizzie] I showed up to practise.
-Yeah.

And I put on
a famous film with a wizard in.

-Oh, let me guess. Harry Potter?
-Oh, yeah.

[Matt] So, you didn't do any baking?

No. Just watched Harry Potter.

-What a wonderful use of your time.
-[chuckles]

[Crystelle] Right, apples.

[Noel] But Lizzie's snaps
face stiff competition.

Battle of the apples.

[Crystelle] This is apple cider vinegar.

It's quite sharp but I just think

it just gives it a bit of that
kind of non-sweetness, which I want.

Erm, Prue said my mini rolls
were a bit sweet last week,

so I'm trying to take on her feedback
like a good student. [chuckles]

[Matt] With a degree
in French and Spanish,

-Crystelle's always been a high achiever.
-[Crystelle] Go. Whoo!

[Matt] On hand to keep her grounded,
are older sisters Chanelle and Corelle.

-[man] Who's the messiest?
-[woman] Oh, Crystelle.

Guys, I'm actually not the messiest.

[Matt] Her cross
between apple pie and crumble,

Crystelle's brandy snap
baskets will be loaded

with tart apple filling
and topped with a vanilla Chantilly cream.

What do you do when you're not baking?
You a wrestler?

-I do argue with my sisters.
-Turns into a wrestling match.

-Basically. Ermâ¦
-You ever attacked them?

No, but once
we were playing the trust game

where you have to fall back.
And I said, "Guys catch me"

and they just both walked past and I fell.

-Awful, I know.
-Off a building.

[chuckles] Fell off a building.
I'm a ghost.

-[Matt] While Crystelle and Lizzie
-[cork pops]

â¦reinvent the brandy snapâ¦

So satisfying, wasn't it?

Apple brandy, apple pie.
Makes sense, doesn't it? Logic.

Right.

â¦Maggie's keeping things classic.

[Maggie] I'm a very traditional baker.

So, my brandy snaps
are traditional brandy snaps.

I think sometimes things
get so over-sophisticated

that it's quite nice to see something
as it was meant to be a long time ago.

[laughs]

[Matt] Since retiring 12 years ago,

Maggie's travelled the world
seeking adventure in her trusty campervan.

Great. You're so much better now.

[Matt] But it's a taste of the English
summer that's inspired her bake.

She'll add crÃ¨me de cassis
and blackcurrants to her cream filling

to help balance
the sweetness of her snaps.

[Maggie] This is my brandy snap.

It's just important the sugar melts
really evenly and that it doesn't boil.

It's a matter of being patient.
Do not rush it at the end.

[George] My sugar's not dissolving.
I've already had half an hour.

Come on, dissolve.

My flavours are gonna be
cinnamon brandy snap.

I'm gonna try and infuse
some of the cream with mastic.

Mastic is from a tree resin that grows
on the Greek island called Chios.

And Chios is where my mum's mum's from.
So my yaya's from there.

[Noel] George's yaya's love of baking

has been passed down
through the generations.

And many of his favourite recipes
come from mum, Spirula.

-[George] Perfect weather for a barbeque.
-Lovely.

[Noel] His brandy snaps
are a celebration of Cypriot flavours.

Chopped pistachios will decorate snaps

filled with orange blossom
and mastic cream.

How much mastika?
Be careful with the amount you put in.

It's quite a strong spice.

I can't have enough.

-It's about whether we can have enough.
-It's been fine in practice.

-Good luck, George. Thank you.
-Thank you.

It's just not dissolving.

I'm gonna turn this baby up.

[Noel] While George is feeling the heatâ¦

This might be a bad decision.

[Matt] Amanda's keeping her cool.

[Amanda] I've tried
a few different brandy snaps

and some of them you can cook on the hob,
melt the butter and the sugar together.

Erm, but this one is just throwing it
all together in one and not cooking it.

I have made them before.
They've come out really well.

Probably beginner's luck,

so I'm hoping today
I'll have beginner's luck again maybe.

[Matt] She might be new to brandy snaps,
but she's been baking since she was nine.

And it's a passion she's determined
to hand on to her teenage daughter Sophia.

I can't read your writin'.

-Writing.
-[enunciating] Writing.

[Matt] For extra flavour, Amanda will
add sesame seeds to her brandy snaps,

which she'll fill with zesty
orange curd and stem ginger cream.

-Paul Hollywood is a big fan of ginger.
-[Amanda] Is he?

-Yeah.
-Is he gonna say he hates ginger?

No.

-He might hate your ginger, but no.
-[chuckles]

He's ginger nuts.

[chuckling] Sorry, that's terrible.

-[Paul] Morning, Freya.
-[Freya] Hello.

-[Paul] All right, brandy snaps.
-I'm doing sort of like a cappuccino.

-Okay.
-[Freya] They've got a coffee liqueur in.

Then I've got
hazelnut praline layer on the top,

'cause I always get
a shot of hazelnut in my cappuccino.

And then I've got like froth on the top

which looks like
the top of the cappuccino.

Can you say cappuccino
one more time for me?

[laughs]

Good girl.

[Noel] A competitive
show jumper since she was 14,

Scarborough-born Freya
loves to hit the beach with horse Winnie.

You are beautiful.

[Noel] Inspired by her favourite drink,

Freya's brandy snap baskets
will combine hazelnut praline

with a coconut-based vegan coffee cream.

So, this is espresso powder.

I was worried that you were gonna think
the coffee was a bit strong,

'cause I like it really strong.

[Prue] I think
it sounds really interesting.

One more cappuccino for the road.

[chuckling] "Cappuccino."

[all laughing]

[Matt] Freya's not the only baker
giving their snaps a caffeine kick.

[Rochica] This is a coffee extract.

[Matt] But Rochica's come
with an extra shot of party vibes.

When I was a rep in Ibiza
I used to get a mocha with Irish cream.

[Matt] HR advisor Rochica
has swapped the beaches of Ibiza

for her sofa in Birmingham
where she now works from home.

Good morning, everyone.

[Matt] Shaped like mini ice-cream cones,

her coffee
and Irish cream-filled brandy snaps

will be decorated
with chocolate and crunchy hazelnuts.

[Rochica] The snap
and the flavour are the most important

and then uniformity
is a very close second.

I'm just weighing out my brandy snap balls

to make sure
they're exactly the same size.

Fifteen grams each.

[Matt] Another baker
keeping a close eye on consistencyâ¦

A heaped teaspoon is one.

â¦Chigs' snaps
come with a soupÃ§on of sophistication.

[Chigs] Mine are espresso
martini brandy snaps.

I do enjoy one now and again.

[Matt] When 40-year-old Chigs
isn't hitting the local cocktail bars,

he enjoys a kick-about
with his nephews Mylan and Lukan.

[Chigs] Oh, no!

[Matt] Flavoured
with coffee liqueur and espresso,

Chigs' boozy coffee cream will fill ginger
and cinnamon-spiced brandy snaps.

So that's the first batch going in now.

The first batch is always touch-and-go,

hence why I made
extra batter just in case.

Yes.

[Noel] Producing perfect,
uniform batches of brandy snapsâ¦

-[Crystelle] Good luck.
-[Maggie] Have fun in there.

â¦will push our bakers to their limit.

I'm sure talking to them helps.

While I've got one batch in, I'll prepare
the next tray with another four.

-You've gotta spin plates in this one.
-[Lizzie] I'm going in.

[Noel] Oven time is critical.

Ten minutes I'm going with.

I'm going in for nine minutes.
I will check them after eight.

[Noel] Made almost entirely from sugar,

the snaps can turn
from underbaked and chewyâ¦

I see these are too blond.

â¦to burnt and bitter
in a matter of seconds.

They've got to be just right,
like the three bears and the porridge.

[Freya] I'm happy with how they look.

They go lacy from the heat,

'cause they bubble up
then the bubbles pop.

[Lizzie] They're not bubbling
and I'm panicking about it.

[Noel] Once out of the oven,

it's a race against the clock
to shape the snaps.

You've got to work really quickly
and they're really hot.

[gasps] Ow, ow, ow, ow.

[Noel] If that wasn't enough
to keep the bakers busyâ¦

[exclaims] I'm making chocolate ganache.

â¦there's the small matter
of their fillings.

I need to make sure I get everything
done properly and within time.

Oops.

Come on.

[Matt] After hitting
the trails with dog Maxie,

Jairzeno likes nothing more
than putting his feet up with a good book.

Having failed to finish
his Showstopper last week,

he's looking to bounce back
with ambitious brandy snaps

filled with dark chocolate
and lime ganache,

passion fruit curd and decorated
with chunks of spiced pineapple.

That is quite complicated.

-Anything else?
-[Prue] Any more layers?

-No.
-What about getting it done on time?

The plan is to get it done on time. Yes.

What I'm thinking about you
is you're quite a laid-back character.

-I am laid-back, so I'llâ¦
-[chuckles]

So my getting going might not be
the equivalent of other people.

Don't encourage him.
He wants to get on with it.

[laughs]

-Bakers, you have one hour lefâ¦
-â¦t.

[exclaims softly]

-I'm not sure that was divided up fairly.
-Oh, it was fine.

-That first hour went quick.
-I am running out of time.

I do need to get a wiggle on,
get my curd made.

[Noel] No matter what the bakers choose
to fill their brandy snaps withâ¦

[Chigs] So that's the cream,
coffee liqueur and espresso shot.

â¦care must be taken
to not only balance their flavoursâ¦

[Maggie] A bit of crÃ¨me de cassis.

[Chigs] I need to taste the alcohol.

I'm just putting the syrup from
the stem ginger into the Chantilly cream.

â¦but textures too.

-[Amanda] And chopped-up ginger.
-[Jairzeno] This is ganache.

Put in more chocolate,
hopefully helps to thicken it up.

[Crystelle] This is my crumble.

It'll have the bite from the crumble,

and then the apples, I want them
to cook down to not like a mush.

Crystelle's got this lovely little
crumble texture going on.

Whereas mine's soft baby mush.

Like one congealed mess.

[Rochica] I'm making
a chocolate Irish cream filling.

I've just added the Irish cream.
There is plenty in here.

I'm measuring out
the spices for my chai crÃ¨me pat.

Erm, I did a few experiments

to get chai flavour into crÃ¨me pat.

I'm using insane amounts.

About 50 grams of cinnamon.
Almost two jars.

[Noel] JÃ¼rgen went
to university in Germany

and with a master's degree in physics,

makes good use of his scientific training
in his baking.

Last week's Star Baker,

JÃ¼rgen's chai spices,
cinnamon, cardamom and clove,

will flavour both his brandy snap baskets
and crÃ¨me patisserie filling.

[JÃ¼rgen] This is my crÃ¨me pat.
I've got starch.

Starch wraps around
protein strands of the egg yolk,

and, er, prevents it from curdling.

I'm a physicist by training.
The curious scientific mind is there.

Now I'm at the critical stage
where the crÃ¨me pat is thickening.

I have just added hazelnut butter
to chocolate crÃ¨me pat.

Hopefully, I got the ratio right.

These are gianduja snaps.

One of my favourite
ice cream flavours as a kid.

[Matt] From a family
of professional chefs,

it was growing up in Italy
that Giuseppe discovered his love of food.

[Giuseppe] Is it good?

[Matt] A passion his children Alberto,
Ricardo and Georgio also share.

Victory!

[Matt] Giuseppe will pipe
swirls of gianduja crÃ¨me pÃ¢tissiÃ¨re

into brandy snap baskets

which he'll also flavour
with chopped roasted hazelnuts.

You've started your batches
of the brandy snaps already.

The crÃ¨me pat is cooling down.
It's done. Now I'm starting offâ¦

-[Prue] First batch of snaps.
-[Giuseppe] Exactly.

Can you get it all out in time,
cool and ready?

It's a very odd way
of starting with your crÃ¨me pat.

But I needed that to be the case

because if it doesn't
cool down sufficiently, it'll melt.

But you won't get the brandy snap
which is the key part.

[Giuseppe] Hopefully.

I don't think
we should stop you doing anything.

We should go away and let you get on.

-Thank you, guys.
-Thank you.

-Good luck.
-Thank you.

You've worked your timings out,
don't listen to those two.

Sure.

Yeah, it's risky, admittedly,
but this is the Bake Off after all.

Uh, it needs to be ambitious,
otherwise there would be no point.

Bakers, you haveâ¦
[sing-song] half an hour.

[both] âª Half an hour, half an hour âª

[sighs]

First batch in,
now we play the waiting game.

These are my last four.
I'm happy with how they look.

-Finally we've got some cones going on.
-These have just stuck.

Come on, little brandy snaps,
you can do this.

I had loads of oil and they came off
perfect the first time.

[JÃ¼rgen] Last batch,
I'm very happy with them.

They have the lacy appearance
like stained-glass windows.

[Jairzeno] Hopefully,
I get a nice tart shape.

It's quite fiddly,
'cause you need to use your hands a lot.

-That's okay, just keep going.
-[Giuseppe] Next in.

[gasps]

Shush!

These look like Paul Hollywood's fingers.

[both laugh]

That's why he doesn't make brandy snaps,
'cause when he picks them up,

he can't tell what's what.

-[Maggie] Hang on, look at these hands.
-[Noel] You've got baker's hands.

-I've got builder's hands. Yes.
-Builder'sâ¦ [laughs]

I'm dipping the ends into the chocolate.
Now I'm gonna fill 'em.

[Rochica] I might need to do this again.

I am just making my filling again.

I think I over-whipped the last one.
I need to just chill.

And stop rushing. Stressing.

[Matt] Rochica's not the only one
starting from scratch.

It's like butter. I don't wanna
use the cream I've made

'cause it's a bit over-whipped.
Time's against me.

I was hoping to be piping
everything by now.

[Giuseppe] I've got
my last batch in the oven.

If I make it, it's gonna be by a second.

-[Chigs] George!
-I ain't got enough time, man.

You have. You've got this, bruv.

-Bakers, you have 15 minutes.
-Do we? [guffaws]

Brilliant.

[laughs] Gotta laugh, haven't you?

I'm never making brandy snaps again.

-This is looking a lot better.
-[Freya] This looks really nice.

The praline is exactly how I hoped.

Check this out, this gun here.
Is that purely from baking?

Well, what my colleague used to say,

I've got it not only here,
I've got it here as well.

[laughs boisterously]

[Maggie] Ooh, got the shakes.

This is just melted chocolate
and it's just to seal the bottom.

The moisture of the cream would melt
the sugar of the basket,

so the chocolate is there
mainly to prevent that.

With the added bonus
of an additional flavour.

I'm putting a layer of the ganache
into each tart case,

then I'll put a layer
of passion fruit curd.

Oh, no, this is disaster.
It's got a bit of ginger in there.

It's blocking the cream.

Oh, man, move it.

-Right, come on, come on, come on.
-How long do I have?

-Bakers, you have one minute left.
-[gasps]

-[George] Oh, get out of the way.
-Come on, George. You can do it.

Oh, sugar. This is terrible.

[JÃ¼rgen] Mango brings a freshness
balancing against the rich spices.

I weighed them all out
and they're still different sizes.

[Crystelle] I'm trying to do
the ugliest ones at the back.

I'm done.

[George] Oh, God,
this cream's going everywhere.

How many have I got now?

-[Giuseppe] There's one, two, threeâ¦
-[exhales]

Bakers, your time is up.

-Oh, done.
-Please step away from your bakes.

-[Chigs] Done it?
-Done it.

-[Freya] Do they look like a cappuccino?
-Yeah, lovely.

-I just hope it's tasty enough.
-Yeah.

-That's all it's all about.
-Yeah.

[Noel] The bakers' brandy snaps

will now face
the judgement of Paul and Prue.

-[Prue] Hello, Freya.
-Hi.

I think they look absolutely scrumptious.

Oh, thank you.

[Paul] They do look quite dark.
Have you got coffee in the snaps?

Yeah, little bit of coffee liqueur.

-[Paul] Nice lace on it though.
-[Prue] A good snap on top.

Hmm, nice flavour.

Quite strong coffee,
maybe even a tiny bit too strong.

How many espressos did you put in there?

-Eight tablespoons.
-Sorry?

-Eight tablespoons?
-I like a lot of coffee.

You needed waking up.
You were steaming drunk last night.

It's not that bad. I love it.

For me, it's just
a little bit too much coffee,

but overall, I think
you've done a decent job.

-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

You made your brandy snaps
with the cold method?

[Amanda] I did.

[Paul] They're very thin
so therefore they're very delicate.

The whole shape of it is falling apart.

But the flavour is absolutely delicious.

Thank you.

[Paul] Stem ginger with the sesame seedâ¦

-Mmm.
-[Prue] It's really lovely.

I would like to just squinch that up,
'cause it doesn't look very good,

and have it for pudding.

-You would, wouldn't you?
-Oh, I would.

Thank you.

Told you he liked ginger, didn't I?

-You did.
-[Matt] Yeah.

[Paul] They're a little bit messy.

The laid-back thing, I'm beginning
to see this in some of your work.

[Jairzeno] There was a bit of rushing
in the last 15 minutes, soâ¦

-[Paul] We've had that before, haven't we?
-We have.

I didn't think the chocolate would go
with those fruit flavours, but it does.

I just think that
the flavours are too strong.

-Oh.
-I mean, I couldn't eat a whole one.

The idea was sound, but not well-executed.

Hmm.

-[Paul] Massive variety in size.
-I did weigh them out so I'm not sure.

[Prue] Some of them
are longer than the others.

[Paul] You've got the Irish cream, coffee,
chocolate and hazelnut.

-I think it's delicious.
-[Prue] And some booze.

Yeah, I added an extra tablespoon.
Thought you might like that.

You're right. You've got me in one.
Well done, Rochica.

-[Prue] Hello, George.
-Hello.

Bit irregular in size. Every one of them.

[crunching]

Mmm.

-That's mastika.
-[Paul] Orange blossom and mastika.

The flavours together work very well.

My issue is they just look a mess.

I'm a perfectionist,
and I really dislike serving that up.

-Wellâ¦
-Yeah.

You should take comfort in the fact
that they are original and sensational.

-[Paul] Thanks, George.
-Yeah, thank you.

-Sensational. Oh, God.
-[Matt] Yeah.

-There you go.
-I nearly fell over.

-[Matt] Well done.
-Cheers.

-[Prue] Hello, Crystelle.
-Hello.

I saw you saying a little prayer then.

Yeah, I was absolutely panicking. [laughs]

-Lovely snap.
-The flavour combination's beautiful.

That lovely crunch
from the crumble and the apples

with that little hint of cinnamon.

-You've done well with the flavours.
-[Prue] And the textures.

Thank you so much. Thanks.

[Paul] What's that on the top?

That's the fast food
clagginess that you get.

The congealed stuff.

Oh, delicious.

Well, I don't know
how to make it sound nice.

-Well, don't say "congealed."
-They're the words that come to me head.

-[Paul] There's very little lace in there.
-Yeah.

But it is delicious. That does
taste of apple. It tastes of brandy.

-[Paul] The crÃ¨me diplomat's nice.
-Altogether it's a lovely mouthful.

-[Paul] Thank you very much.
-Ta.

[Prue] That's really pretty.

I think they look very elegant,
pretty uniform in colour,

nice lace as well in the brandy snap.

Let's see what it tastes like.

The brandy snap is delicious,
crisp, nicely flavoured.

[Paul] Chocolate doesn't
come through massively strong.

So what's happened is
it's sort of lost its way.

You do get this blast of hazelnut,
but otherwise, you've done very well.

-Cheers, guys.
-[Prue] Well done.

[Prue] They're nice and lacy.

[Paul] The chocolate comes through,
the brandy snap's got a lovely snap.

Just the right amount of sweetness
in there as well.

The cream's okay, but you've lost
a little bit of the coffee flavour.

-It's just a little bit weak.
-Fair enough.

-Very good.
-Thank you very much.

[Prue] They're very small

and they could have had
a more colour on them.

I'm really quite disappointed.

[Prue] Because you've done a traditionalâ¦

-[Maggie] Yes.
-â¦filled brandy snap.

-The cream has sogged up the brandy snap.
-Yes.

Which weren't quite baked enough anyway
so they're really chewy.

-Right.
-But they are delicious.

[Paul] I love the tanginess
from the blackcurrant,

but, um, the practicalities really
haven't worked out very well.

No indeed,
and that's what's disappointing.

-Onwards and upwards.
-[laughs]

Thank you very much.

[Paul] Overall, they look pretty good.

[Prue] Nice and even.
They are lovely and thin.

-[crunches]
-[Matt] I hear a crunch.

-[Prue] Mmm-hmm.
-I can.

The blend of the spices,

the cardamom and the cinnamon
work beautifully well.

It's so easy to get it wrong
by putting too much in,

it overwhelms either the brandy snap
or the cream.

But it just doesn't. I think
texture-wise, you've done well as well.

The crÃ¨me pat's perfect.
It's not too stodgy.

-I think you've done well on that. Yeah.
-[Prue] Mmm.

[Paul] Thank you, JÃ¼rgen.

-I'm just gonna try a bit myself.
-[JÃ¼rgen] Yes.

-It means nothing from me.
-It means a lot for me.

-Oh, you can come back. Thank you.
-Welcome.

[JÃ¼rgen] Couldn't have gone better.

It was definitely worth
developing the spice chai crÃ¨me pat.

Which took a lot of time, was amazing.

Flavour's good. They liked the clagginess,
which is what I was after.

Maybe I shouldâ¦ I need a vocabulary.

So I canâ¦ Is it, not a vocabularâ¦

What's a dictionâ¦ Like the dictionâ¦
Thesaurus, I need a thesaurus.

We won't just expand on baking,
we'll expand my mind.

[Giuseppe] The comments were very positive
and, uh, very constructive.

This is a good step
in the right direction.

Prue used the word "sensational."

In my head all I've got is,
uh, "they didn't look right."

But she really liked it.

[Jairzeno] The finish was rushed
because I was rushing at the end,

so if I was judging, I would agree
with them about the messiness.

Well, it was a bit of a disaster, really.

In the technical this afternoon.

I can only go up from here,
there is no going down.

[Matt] Biscuit week isn't about to get
any easier for our 11 bakers

who now face a mystery
shrouded in gingham.

Bakers, it's time
for your technical challenge

which today has been set by Paul.

-Paul, any words of advice?
-[all chuckle]

This is pretty straightforward,
but read your recipe.

We want perfection.

[Matt] As ever, this task is judged blind,

so we will ask Paul and Prue
to leave the tent.

[Noel] Bye-bye.

What I don't understand

is Paul's standing there,
scowling at everyone.

-Why doesn't he just tell 'em what to do?
-He's got a lot on his mind.

Like what?

He's deciding whether to watch
Fast & Furious 6 or The Expendables 3.

[all laugh]

Bakers, for your technical challenge,

Paul would like you
to make that childhood favourite,

the sandwiched jammy biscuit.

Made up of two perfectly-baked
short and tender biscuits,

perfectly set jam and smooth buttercream.

We would like you to make 12 biscuits.

You have one hour and 45 minutes.

-[Noel] On your marksâ¦
-Get setâ¦

[Noel] Bake.

[Chigs] I've had jam biscuits,
the sandwich ones.

I think I know what I'm doing.
Just need to make sure they're perfect.

[Rochica] I've never made jammy biscuits,
but I have eaten them.

I kind of know what I'm looking for.

[Amanda] Who makes biscuits
you can buy in the shop?

You can get a tub for 11p, can't you?

Paul, jammy biscuits, why?

I think jammy biscuits should
be a very familiar biscuit to the bakers

and I thought it'd be a great challenge.

The recipe is pretty straightforward,

but you gotta get
all the elements spot-on.

We've given the bakers stamps to get
that definition in those lines and swirls.

And how you get the definition
is chilling the biscuit dough down.

If it's soft when you press it,
you're going to lose that ridge.

And obviously we're looking
for the same thickness.

You don't want a thin top and a fat base.

And what about texture?
Is it a shortbread?

It is. When you bite in,
you have that gorgeous biscuit

that snaps in the mouth
and that buttery flavour inside.

See, the jam cuts the sweetness a bit.

That's really lovely.
I thought this was a simple biscuit.

It's deceptively difficult.
It's quite a warm day.

It's all to do
with the temperature of the dough.

-They've gotta use the fridge.
-It's not that hot.

Well, for you. You're South African.

Paul said,
"Read the recipe very carefully."

So I'm trying to ponder
on every single word.

I think he's taking the mickey when
he said read your instructions. That's it.

They want you to be in the know-know,
but you don't know.

The first thing to do is make
a smooth raspberry jam.

Put the jam, sugar in there,
and all the raspberries.

I'm not a jam maker. I'm a jam eater.
I don't even eat that much jam, either.

I'll leave that to heat up
and get all mushy.

So I'm now just on to me biscuits
while me jam heats up.

Next thing says, "Make the biscuit dough."

Easy peasy.

Given the order
the ingredients are listed,

I think the creaming method
will work best for this one.

[Freya] Ooh, bit fast.

And the creaming
of the butter incorporates air.

Soon as that's light and fluffy
I'm gonna add the egg vanilla extract

and then I'm gonna sift the cornflour

and the flour together
and then I'll put that in last.

What does a tender biscuit mean?
I've heard of a short biscuit.

But a tender biscuit?

Yeah, I don't know what he's on about.

-Sensitive biscuit. Sensitive, tenderâ¦
-Yeah. Yeah.

-Emotional.
-Bit like me.

I'm just concerned.
This batter's literally wet.

I want it to be a lot firmer.

Because it's hot in here
the butter's really soft.

I'm gonna chill it down for a bit.

You've got to rest it for a while
before it gets workable

to get the butter solid again.

It's in there.

Jam is almost at jam temperature.
I'm just gonna let that bubble.

The setting point is about
105 degrees Celsius.

So I reached that
and I did a setting test.

If you put a drop of jam
onto the bowl, you nudge the drop,

you get this kind of skin ripple,
that should be perfect.

[Rochica] Oh, no. I just burnt it.
I wasn't paying attention.

I can't use that.

I'm just gonna start again.
And hopefully I won't burn this one.

They want a smooth
raspberry jam, so no bits.

[JÃ¼rgen] The jam should set,
fingers crossed.

[Crystelle] That is the amount
of jam I have. What?

I cooked it to the jam temperature.
I think. Not very much, is it?

[Matt] Bakers, you are halfway through.

[Freya] It says roll out the doughâ¦
[Lizzie] Using the "flutteredâ¦"

I think that's how you pronounce it.

"Use the fluted cutter
to create 24 rounds."

Fluted. Oh, okay. Fluted cutter.

[George] Is that fluted?

That must be fluted,
'cause that's just round.

[Lizzie] Learn a new word every day.

I think I can just about
get 12 biscuits on one sheet.

[Crystelle] It's such a soft dough.

I have no idea
how I'm gonna cut out circles of this.

[Freya] It's so hot in here.
The butter's just completely melting.

I'm just gonna throw them
back in the freezer again.

I'm chilling the dough
to get it stiff enough to work with.

[Amanda] I'd like the dough to be harder.
It's still quite soft.

Just need to keep an eye on that jam
because I don't want to burn it again.

Gonna start rolling the dough out.

Okay, "Make the buttercream."
Lots of detail, as always.

He's emphasised in the recipe, "smooth."
He's in smooth mode.

[JÃ¼rgen] The longer you beat it,
the smoother it will become.

I'm gonna beat this
until the cows come home.

[Rochica gasps] Fluted. Oh, no.

I've cut them round and not fluted.

-Bakers, you have--
-Whoa, what are you doing?

I'm gonna tell 'em
how long they've got left.

No, don't do that.
No spoilers, I'm watching the show.

-[Noel] I've gotta tell--
-[Matt] No, don'tâ¦

Okay, cover your ears.

Bakers, you have half an hour left.

Yeah. No spoilers, please.

Okay. I've got to go back to the biscuits.

-[Amanda] It's quite cold.
-[Giuseppe] Set enough.

[JÃ¼rgen] "Using the biscuit stamp,
emboss the biscuits."

-Ah, yes.
-[Lizzie] It is quite cool, isn't it?

The biscuit dough was sticking
to the stamp, so I've floured it.

Why?

With a heart-shaped cutter,
stamp a single heart shape

out of the centre
of 12 of your stamped rounds.

They're so soft I can't get it out.
It's like mashed potato.

[Noel] Turning out biscuits with
perfectly-defined hearts and swirlsâ¦

[George] What is this? What is this?

...will be nigh on impossible.

[Crystelle] It's very soft, but I should
get them in the oven.

[Noel] Unless their dough is chilled
to a firm texture before it's baked.

[Giuseppe]
There is so much butter in there.

If you put it straight in the oven
the whole dough will collapse.

I'll stick these in the freezer.

[Giuseppe] This is the trickiest part.
If I rush this, I will ruin it.

Although if I look around the room

I can see people
sticking stuff in the oven

and that's getting me anxious.

[George] I'm going in the oven.

[Maggie] I would like to have them
in the freezer before I cook them.

But I don't want to run out of time.

And I'm going to bake them
for six minutes.

I feel like these biscuits
can't catch any colour.

They're very pale, aren't they?
Anaemic biscuits?

I just have to wait. This is killing me.

[Freya] I'm doing the same as you--

Let's not open it,
let's wait for two minutes.

[Noel] You've written
your own notes on Paul's recipe?

-Are you just writing bottom?
-[Maggie] Went in at bottom at three.

Paul Hollywood's bottom.
I've seen it. It's like two beige moons.

Dancing in the sky.

Take this man away.

I'm far too old to cope with that.

-Although the thought is rather nice.
-[both laughing]

This biscuit dough is so soft. Oh, no.

I might have to try stamping them
afterwards and see what happens.

I need to cut a heart out.
This challenge is so deceitful.

It's nice and cold in that freezer.

[JÃ¼rgen] I'll put them in the oven.
It should keep definition.

I'm gonna have a go.

[JÃ¼rgen] It's 150 degrees
so it's not too hot.

I'll check in five minutes.

[timer beeping]

-You having a daydream then?
-No, I'm just waiting for the biscuits.

[Noel] I thought you were thinking,

"if I pull this tent down
and push Giuseppe over,

I'll go down in history
as the most disruptive baker."

Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

[Lizzie] Oh, no.

I'm going in for eight minutes.
And I've bumped it up to 160.

Come on, come on, come on, come on.

-[Lizzie] This is awful, George.
-It's a horrible challenge.

-Matt, come here.
-[Matt] Yeah?

-Look how tidy this is.
-[Matt] Wow.

And look, shambles.

-It's a mess.
-[Crystelle] What are you saying about me?

That your whole work area
is an absolute shambles.

-It's devastating. Look at this bench.
-She's not allowed to look.

-Yeah, you're not allowed to look.
-[JÃ¼rgen] She's not allowed to look.

[Lizzie] Coming out,
they haven't really got a swirl.

They are coming out now
whether they like it or not.

I think they're done. [exclaims]

Oh, my God. What's wrong with you?
Don't panic.

-[Crystelle] I'm not panicking.
-[Noel] You only lost one.

[Crystelle] And I've got a few spares.

Yeah. They look all right.

They're a bit pale,
but if I wait any longer,

I probably won't be able to finish them.

[Chigs] I'm gonna have to
sacrifice the swirl.

[Maggie] They've just got to be cold.

If they're hot, the buttercream
is just gonna go bleurgh.

[Rochica] They're not baking that well.

-[JÃ¼rgen] Happy.
-[Giuseppe] That'll do.

[Amanda] They won't take long to cool,
they're really thin.

[Rochica] Hmm. Gonna cut it fine.

How long have we got left?

Bakers, you have five minutes left.

Yeah, I'm gonna go back in.
I'd rather have a baked biscuit.

"To serve, sandwich the biscuits

with a layer of buttercream
and a layer of jam."

Putting the buttercream on atom by atom.

Look at the colour of this jam.
It's beautiful.

[Crystelle] Man, I can't believe
this happened to my jam.

I've never handled jam like this
in my life.

Bakers, you have one minute left.

Dust with icing sugar,
leaving the heart visible.

-[Freya] I just need to dust.
-Come on, come on, come on.

[JÃ¼rgen] Yeah, good, I think.

These are so dodgy.
And I'm never, ever making these again.

[Rochica] Ah! Terrible.

Size is a bit different, but they're here.

[Rochica] Yeah,
they're still a bit doughy.

Bakers, your time is up.

Step away from your bakes.

-Cheers.
-[Crystelle] Cheers.

Oh. JÃ¼rgen's tucking in.

-[Noel] Good?
-They're awful, but they're done.

Please bring your biscuits
down to the gingham table.

-That be a lot of biscuits.
-[Noel] A lot of biscos.

[Matt] Paul and Prue are expecting
12 uniform short jammy biscuits

with clearly-defined swirls and hearts,

deliciously tart raspberry jam
and ultra-smooth buttercream.

And they have no idea whose is whose.

Right, shall we start over here?

-[Prue] They've lost a lot of definition.
-[Paul] And they're different sizes.

The top ones aren't so well baked
which is why the bottom ones are smaller.

The texture's there, it's crumbly.

And you have the set jam and buttercream.

It's just an issue with the look.

Okay, moving on to number two,
it's lost some of its shape.

Quite flat, aren't they? See the
difference with the top and the bottom?

-[Prue] That's been rolled too thinly.
-[Paul] Mmm-hmm. It's about consistency.

It's a little hard. It's not buttery.

-[Paul] But when you look at theseâ¦
-[Prue] Colour and definition are good.

[Paul] There's a couple where the top
is much smaller than the bottom.

-It's nice and delicate, crumbly.
-[Prue] Mmm.

-It's got a good flavour.
-It's a proper shortbread.

[Paul] Moving on, you want the icing sugar
to highlight stuff, not hide stuff.

We will find it.

[all chuckling]

-Thick at the bottom, thin at the top.
-They are slightly underbaked.

[Paul] Okay, moving on.

-[Prue] Very small.
-[Paul] Yeah, they are.

But they're pretty consistent
all the way down, yeah.

But there's no definition in there at all.

-Or underneath.
-[Prue] No.

Mmm.

But the biscuit is lovely.
As it should be.

[Paul] Yeah. Now these look good.

The hearts are quite defined.

There's a bit of definition
on there from the lines.

[Prue] Yeah.

Hmm.

-[Paul] It's got a good consistency.
-[Prue] They're very nice.

[Paul] There's a bit of definition
but there's inconsistencies.

It's quite thick, that buttercream.

I like the biscuit.
But it's a bit too much jam.

[Paul] It's too sweet.

Erm, moving on,
a lot of icing sugar again.

[Prue] This is very dark jam.

I reckon I could paste
a poster on the wall with that.

It's been over-boiled.

The jam ruins that
'cause it alters all the textures.

This has lost a lot of its shape.

[Prue] Those are very uneven.

[Paul] You've got to
cut and chill the biscuit.

That's how you get the definition
and stop it from shrinking in the oven.

The jam looks great,
but that buttercream, it's justâ¦

-[Prue] Hardly any.
-â¦a thin smear. Slightly underdone.

Talking of underdone.

[Prue] That's got
no stamp on it at all, has it?

-This is raw actually.
-Probably hasn't even hit the fridge.

Hasn't hit the oven either.
At least not for long enough.

[Paul] There's a bit of definition here.

-They're a bit thin.
-[Prue] I quite like them thin.

Cream's good, shape's good.

-I think the jam flavour is good.
-[Paul] Jam's good.

[Matt] Paul and Prue will now rank
the jammy biscuits from worst to best.

In 11th spot is this one.

-Rochica, did it actually go in the oven?
-It did.

It needed longer, there's no definition.

In tenth place, we have this one.
Jam ruined it, I'm afraid.

In ninth spot we have this one.

Very little definition, very, very thin.

[Matt] George is eighth, Chigs seventh,
Lizzie sixth, Maggie fifth

and Amanda is fourth.

In third spot we have this one.

-Whose is this?
-That's me.

Freya, these weren't too bad.
You've lost a little bit of definition

but you were nearly there.
Little bit longer in the oven.

In second place, this one.

Giuseppe, I thought
these were absolutely lovely.

But you could've put
a bit more filling in them.

So in first spot we have this one.

-[cheering]
-Crazy.

You did have the definition
and the biscuit tasted lovely.

Thank you.

[JÃ¼rgen] It's almost unreal.

It's an unbelievable day
and I'm truly exhausted now.

JÃ¼rgen has been renamed
"The Baking Terminator."

Nothing stops him.

He doesn't have the Austrian accent,

but he's German,
so it's close enough. [laughs]

[Rochica] Definitely the hardest moment
in the tent for me. I'm still optimistic.

It all rests on tomorrow.

[Jairzeno] It could've gone better today.

Even though you plan so much,
the time just seems toâ¦ yeah.

A bad morning and I needed a little higher
to bring me out of the depths.

I feel I'm under
a lot of pressure tomorrow.

[Noel] There's just the Showstopper
challenge left before Prue and Paul decide

who'll be leaving the tent
and who's destined for Star Baker.

Hello and welcome to the Matt Lucas Show

with my special guests,
the Beverley Sisters.

[Noel chuckles]

[Matt] For your Showstopper challenge,

Prue and Paul want you to make

a 3D biscuit replica
of your favourite childhood toy.

[Noel] Your biscuit toy
needs to be delicious,

but also there needs
to be an interactive element.

[Matt] It could be wheels
that turn on a car,

or lighting in a doll's house

or Internet in case they wanna get
some work emails out of the way

before the weekend or hop on a Zoom.

[Noel] I had a Zoom
with a doll the other week.

It was Chucky the killer doll.

Nice guy, actually, off camera.

[Matt] I actually facetimed Action Man
the other day.

Great body but, uh, took his trousers offâ¦
[whispering] nothing there.

-[Noel] You have four hours.
-[normally] On your marks.

-Get set.
-Bake.

[Rochica] I really need to do well today.

Just wanna keep a cool head.

[Maggie] I'm feeling
absolutely fine this morning.

There's only one place to go
today and that's up.

[Lizzie] This bake brings back
loads of kid memories.

Yeah, just fills me with joy
just looking at it.

[Prue] This week's Showstopper
is a childhood toy

and we want them to be interactive.

Children's toys are not much fun
if they don't do something,

but it's quite difficult
to do out of biscuit.

The bakers have to be
engineers as well as bakers,

because they need to think
about how they're gonna bring

this three-dimensional
biscuit scene together.

I think they're gonna use
something like a gingerbread,

because it's robust, it's strong.

If it's too soft it could just collapse.

-[Paul] Hi, George.
-Hi.

Tell us all about your toy biscuit design.

So I'm doing an aeroplane.

My aeroplane used to stick on my ceiling

and it had a propeller that turned.

You'd throw it and it'd go round the room.
I was fascinated by it.

[Matt] Whizzing high
above Greek biscuit clouds,

George's gingerbread aeroplane
will be crafted from ten separate pieces

and has a special feature.

It's got a motor
that takes the plane round.

-You've got a motor?
-Yes.

Wow.

Have you got enough time?

'Cause it sounds
like you'd need about two years.

I know. I've got an awful lot to do.

-Keep working.
-I will.

-Good luck, mate.
-Yeah. Thanks.

[Noel] While George plays planes,
Lizzie's off on the road.

[Lizzie] I am making a chocolate
and ginger toy truck.

I should know how to build cars.
I do work in a car factory.

[Noel] Her chocolate gingerbread truck
will feature moving wheels

and for extra interactive fun, she'll add
a paint palette so it can be coloured in.

[Noel] Making a little Brum-Brum car.
Paul's favourite.

Your favourite, too.
There's an art palette.

I don't have anything to do
with the judging, you know that, right?

-You're bribing the wrong cat.
-That's fine. [laughs]

[Matt] Jairzeno's hoping to bribe
the judges with a toy vehicle of his own.

[Jairzeno] I'm making a sailing ship,

I've always been interested
in all those ships and all those sails.

[Matt] After capsizing in his signature,
today he needs to stay afloat.

But the ship has a heavy load,
biscuit treasure, battery-powered lights,

two masts and colossal rice paper sails.

[Jairzeno] The sails are kind of big

so if my sailing ship could just stand up,
you know, I'll be happy.

[Noel] Maggie's also off to sea.

[Maggie] As a post-war child,
there weren't many toys around.

But we always went to the beach,
'cause it was a cheap day out.

We had access to people with beach huts.

So skim boards, bodyboards,
that kind of thing were part of our life.

[Noel] With childhood toys
in short supply,

she's making the beach her toy,

featuring a gingerbread surfer
who can be pulled through the waves.

I mean my first thought
was this is not a toy.

-[Maggie] No.
-[Prue] But you can play with models.

[Maggie] With all honesty,
I can't remember a favourite toy.

-Bucket and spade, that was a toy.
-Bucket and spade.

[Matt] Toys were also a luxury
in JÃ¼rgen's childhood days.

[JÃ¼rgen] My brother and myself
didn't have many toys

because we grew up very poor.

And so my grandpa made some windmills.

So we had a mini Dutch windmill
on a pole in the garden.

[Matt] JÃ¼rgen's gingerbread windmill
is the tallest toy in the tent.

Engineered with a hidden wooden axle,

the top turns
and tuile biscuit sails spin.

So that's the interactive bit.

-It actually moves.
-Clever.

-[JÃ¼rgen] I hope to have no breakages.
-[Paul] Good luck, JÃ¼rgen.

-Thank you very much.
-You don't need luck.

[Noel] To help keep lady luck on side,

most of the bakers are working
with sturdy gingerbread.

Very few biscuits are strong enough
to support a 3D structure,

other than ginger biscuits or gingerbread.

[Noel] But just how stable
their 3D toys are

depends on how thin they roll.

[Rochica] I've done it as thin as I could.

I don't want the biscuits to be too thin,
'cause then they won't hold up.

-[Noel] And the bake.
-Good luck, my little pretties.

Toy truck. Fifteen minutes.

[Noel] Perfectly baked gingerbread
should be crisp on the outside

with a tender centre.

And while delicious to eat,
could be too weak to build with.

It's all a balancing act,
because if you bake them nice and soft

it might fall under its own weight.

[Noel] A risk Freya isn't willing to take.

I want them like quite dark.
Overly done, you know?

[Noel] Named after
her beloved horse Winnie,

she aims to stay in the saddle
with a vegan rocking horse

and Freya's hoping
her well-baked gingerbread

will give her the edge
during construction.

I think it is quite a test
of people's ability

to structurally build things.

We are hoping for the best with Winnie.

[Matt] But Winnie isn't the only horse
Prue and Paul will get to play with.

[Amanda] I am doing a rocking horse.

I'm not the only one doing
a rocking horse, no.

[giggles]

The lovely Freya's doing
a rocking horse as well.

They're different.
Mine's American sugar cookie.

[Matt] Amanda's the only baker
to reject sturdy gingerbread,

risking a soft-baked sugar cookie instead.

Flavoured with lemon and cardamom,

she'll assemble pieces
of her delicate biscuit

to create a working rocking horse.

I think it's very ambitious.

I was gonna go for
the gingerbread as an easier option,

but I can't stand a hard biscuit.
I like the bite in it a bit more buttery.

-Have you practised this?
-I have, yeah.

Okay. Well, good luck.

I'm coming out.

I'm starting to think
that I've over-baked it.

But it's better very hard.
At least it's not gonna fall down.

[Matt] While the gingerbread bakers

have made their biscuits
as hard as they dareâ¦

Are these supposed to be
quite as brown as they are?

-Yes. They have a suntan.
-Ah, they do.

â¦Amanda's soft-baked
sugar cookie rocker has already cooled.

[Amanda] Just gonna go for it.

[Matt] And she's ready
to start constructing.

[Amanda] I've got horrible visions
of this thing just cracking open.

I just can't risk the biscuit breaking,
'cause it's holding the whole body up.

[yelling]

Oh, it collapsed.

Quick. Repair, repair, repair.

God.

It's not good.

Bakers, you are halfway "througe".

-It's pronounced "through."
-Is it?

Also you've been saying
her name wrong. It's Pruge, not Prue.

-Oh.
-[Amanda] God.

I've just glued it back together again
with some sugar. I'm panicking.

[Noel] How are you?

-I'm okay, thank you.
-Yeah?

-Yeah.
-Really?

You've done something wrong, haven't you?

There was a tiny little breakage.
My horse is not rocking.

[Noel] Bet you were naughty at school.

-I was a bit naughty at school, yeah.
-How can I tell?

-[Amanda] But I didn't smash stuff.
-[Noel] No.

[Amanda] Oh, I did break a window.

Well, look, don't break any windows,
tear any flaps.

-[chuckles] Okay. I know what you mean.
-Tent. You know.

Tent flaps. I got it, it's fine.

This has gone somewhere.
I can't even pull this out of the gutter.

[chuckling]

[Noel] While Amanda worries
about her rocking horseâ¦

[Amanda] If I move it,
it'll probably break,

but don't forget,
this rocking horse is really old.

â¦the rest of the bakers
press on with decoration.

That bikini looks like
Elton John's glasses.

[Maggie laughs]

I don't want them to say, "That's a mess."

It's Paul and Prue airlines, man.

[Chigs] I'm just trying to get my balls
prepped now, ready to go.

Mine is gonna be a snooker table.

Playing snooker
was a big part of my childhood.

Brings back fond memories.

[Matt] Chigs' spiced gingerbread
snooker table will be fully functional

with balls made from fondant icing
and biscuit cues.

-[Matt] Are you a good snooker player?
-I used to be okay.

-[Matt] Really?
-Yes.

âª Snooker loopy nuts are we
Me and him and them and me âª

âª We'll show you what you can do
With a load of balls and a snooker cue âª

Yay, get in there.

[Noel] Games are proving
a popular toy in the tent.

So I'm making a game called reversi.

I found out recently
that it's actually a very old game.

It dates back from the 19th century.

[Noel] Giuseppe will harness
his skills as an aircraft engineer

to build his ancient game complete
with curved counter grooves

and 30 chocolate orange sable counters.

There are some engineering aspects
into doing this,

especially for the assembly.

[Matt] Rochica also fancies a game.

[Rochica] I'm making
a pinball Showstopper.

[Matt] And hers has even more complex
parts to engineer.

You'll be able to use the flickers
as well, to flick the ball.

The ball rolls down the ramp, so yeah.

[Matt] Having come last
in the technical challenge,

she hopes her dynamic
pinball game will be a winner.

It features a lemon shortbread ramp,
multiple wheels and marshmallow balls.

[Rochica] So this will be
the marshmallow pinball.

Oh, my gosh, what a mess. I'm stressed.

Oh. [chuckling] Stuck myself together.

[Noel] Crystelle also needs to better
her poor technical performance

and she's going all out
with her toy today.

[Crystelle] This is a little vanity unit.

So I am making
poppy seed biscuit lipsticks,

my makeup brushes and a sugar mirror.

I'm quite tight on time today. Come on.
Right, I'm movingâ¦ [gasps]

My mumâ¦ Right, we're fine.

[Noel] Made from over 50 parts,
her vanity playset features

lemon and poppyseed lipsticks and a
gingerbread drawer with jewellery inside.

Sweet lights surround the mirror.

-[Noel] I fell through a mirror once.
-[Crystelle] Through it?

And ended up in this tent and I haven't
managed to get out since I've been here.

-Oh.
-And later on--

-You're gonna jump in there.
-I'm gonna jump through that.

-God, it sounds like a film.
-It does sound like a film.

-Or an A-ha video.
-[Crystelle laughs]

Bakers, you have one hour left.

You know it's pronounced "our," right?

-What school did you go to?
-I didn't go to school. I'm a feral child.

I was raised by pangolins.

[Amanda] Okay, I wanna
get the body on the slats.

[exhales] I need to build myself up to it.

Construction, that's the hardest bit,
fitting pieces of gingerbread together.

[Rochica] I'm using isomalt,
which is sugar,

to keep everything in place.

I need to make sure I'm careful,
and I've got on my gloves as well.

Hopefully, the whole thing
doesn't collapse under its weight.

-I can't even breathe now.
-Please don't let this fall.

[whimpers]

If that could just stay up.
Yeah, I'm rolling.

If you finish today, Paul's gonna do
a small dance in your honour.

In a skimpy dress.

[George] No pressure. Come on.

How long have we got?

[Matt] Bakers, you have half an hour left.

Guys, I'm freaking out.

[Freya] So stressful doing this in a rush.

[Lizzie] I'm assembling a car
with great difficulty.

I hope the windmill spins.
They're quite important.

[Amanda] Okay, I have to do it.

Oh, God, it's gonna fall.

This is the bit where
it all goes wrong, isn't it?

The snooker table. It's behaving
at the moment. [laughs nervously]

There's several in it, so that's good.

[Crystelle] Come on.

Hold the top, just don't let them
slip out your hands, please.

Okay.

Just wanna keep a cool head, keep going.

-[Giuseppe] It's very tense, definitely.
-[George] Come on, man.

Please don't fall.

Oh, my God, what did you just do?

Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

It's gonna go.

Something's going.

[yelling]

Breakage.

Don't know what I'm doing.

Quick, repair.

[George] Shall we see if it goes 'round?

Oh, dear.

Yeah, I mean,
there's an element of movement.

No, it should be moving.

If it collapses it collapses. [sighs]

[Amanda] Mine's proper broken already.

Ooh.

The beach huts are a little bit messy.
But I've got the shakes.

[George] Motor broke.

Oh, for God's sake.

Can't work out what's wrong.

You know what's wrong? British technology.

[laughs]

Typical.

It broke.

[Amanda] Oh, no, my legs are falling off.

Can I help?

[Amanda] I might try
and stick some more glue on it.

-[Freya] Right, well, I've got it.
-Thank you, darling.

What do they do with horses
that have broken legs?

-Shoot 'em.
-[chuckling] I know.

[Crystelle] Hearts.

[Chigs] Snooker balls.

-[Giuseppe] Counters.
-[George] Yes.

[exclaiming]

I can stick that through the ship.

[Amanda] Thank you, darling.

[Freya] Right.

[Maggie] It's not very neat.

[Jairzeno] Scary putting this together.

Nearly there, nearly there.

[George] Candyfloss. Form the clouds.

[Chigs] Making it look as good as I can.

[motor whirring noisily]

[Amanda] Just gonna go for it. [yelling]

Oh, no. Oh, no.

-Disaster strikes.
-[both chuckle]

[Amanda] It's gone.

Bakers, your time is up.

Please step away from your biscuity bakes.

[Jairzeno] Oh, no. It's more like
a shipwreck than a ship.

[Maggie] It's just messy.

-[Chigs] Come on, don't cry.
-I know.

[Amanda yelling]

Mine's just completely collapsed.

-[Freya] No, no, no.
-[Amanda] The head's come off.

[Chigs] Oh, babe.

Disaster.

That was so pretty though, Amanda.

Yeah. Compared to my ship.

What do you want, some buttercream?

I need some comfort.

Thank you.

[Matt] It's judgement time
for the bakers' interactive toys.

George, would you like to fly on down?

-[motor whirring]
-[all cheering]

That is really wonderful.

That is definitely interactive.

-That's amazing.
-Even sounds like a plane.

It's a pretty basic plane,
but it does go round.

The design on this is great.

[Noel groans]

-That can be repaired.
-[laughs]

Nice wing.

It's not too hard. But it's very crisp.

-Shall we taste both?
-[Paul] They work well as a sort of cloud.

[Prue] What are the flavours in there?

-Pistachios, brandy.
-What's not to like?

-Well done, George. Thank you.
-Thanks.

That's so good. So good.

[Paul] Ingenious.
You have a lot of moving parts.

You can play with it. Look.

-[exclaims]
-Oh, no. [laughs]

You've broken it on the first go.

[Prue] I did. But we can do it like that.

[Paul] Yes.

It's so delicate, it's so thin.

-The texture's spot-on.
-[Prue] Very good.

-Thank you.
-[Paul] Thank you, Rochica.

Properly engineered.

The way that the counters sit in
the little recess here. It looks amazing.

It's a very classic ginger biscuit.
I quite like that.

It's the cardamom
and the cloves coming through.

-[Prue] Well done, Giuseppe.
-Thank you.

-[all cheering]
-[Paul] Oh, nearly!

That's very clever.

-[Prue] Now it just has to taste wonderful
-I know.

[Prue] And it's a little bit cakey.

But I like that, especially if it's thick,
you don't want it to be too hard.

[Paul] It's perfect.

-But you're missing a row of red balls.
-[Chigs] I know.

-Trust you to count them.
-[all laugh]

There's a show, "Paint Along with Prue."

[Paul] Getting out of jail free
by adding that palette

and saying "paint it yourself"
is interesting.

The ginger and the chocolate together,
it is probably too strong.

-Okay.
-[Prue] You know what?

If you have it with a bit of icing,
it tones it down and it's delicious.

-Well done.
-Ta.

[Matt] Well done.

With that painting skills, you could get
a job in our factory if this goes wrong.

Done.

[Prue] Look at that.

[Prue chuckles]

You've created quite a high structure,

but having said that, it is so thin.

[Prue] Well I agree, it's sehr gut.

-It really is.
-Danke schÃ¶n.

It looks beautiful.

[Paul grunts]

It's not overly sweet at all.

But it's got
a lovely flavour in the mouth.

-[Prue] Very nice.
-[Paul] You've done a great job.

Again. Konditor meister.

-Thank you.
-[Matt] Well done.

Oh, God. Gonna be sick. I can't do this.

[Noel] Paul would look good with them on.

[all laughing]

No one's ever looked more like a pirate.

[Prue] I'll taste the brush.

Lovely. Lemon and poppy.

Yeah.

-[Prue] Beautiful.
-I think the design's very clever.

And I think you've got
your flavours spot on too.

-[sighs in relief]
-[Prue] Well done.

I think that's beautiful.
And I love the painting.

Do you think it could be a bit softer?

I think it's okay, considering
what it's doing. It's not overly hard.

Structurally she's pretty sound as well.

Thank you so much.

[Prue sighs]

The saddle is beautiful,
the tail, the head.

Must have been heartbreaking
to see the thing collapse.

It was a little bit, yeah.

[Prue] Let's see what it tastes like.

It's a sugar biscuit
and that's, erm, honey buttercream.

-It's brave not to do gingerbread.
-Thank you.

I would never in a million years
have chosen that biscuit to build this.

-It's so delicate.
-[Prue] Mmm.

But you managed to--

I've made it three times before
and it stayed up.

[Paul] Just a shame
it looks the way it does.

It would've been right up there.

Would admit that's some of the best
biscuit things that we'd have ever had.

Thank you.

I'll get in the TARDIS
and we'll go back in time.

-Yeah, I've flown it before.
-[mouthing]

[Paul] For me, it's a bit basic.

I think, as a decoration,
it needs to be a lot more elaborate.

[Prue] But I think we need
to taste the gingerbread.

[Paul] I would've made that a little bit
thinner to allow a nice snap.

-Yes.
-It's a little bit thick and heavy.

I think if you were looking
at a traditional school report,

it'd say, "Needs to try harder."

-[Matt] Well done.
-[Noel] Well done, Maggie.

Looks a bit rough and ready.

The rough-and-ready look
of the painting was deliberate.

And there were two sails.

There was a tall sail at the back,
but the mast broke.

-'Cause of the water, the waves.
-[Matt laughing]

It's the way the cargo was loaded,
that was the problem.

-And that too, yeah.
-[Prue chuckling]

Don't give me that waffle.

Let's have a go at the biscuit.

Mmm, the cardamom
comes through well in that.

It's a lovely blend.

[Prue] It tastes delicious,
but it's a bit rough and ready.

-[Paul] Thank you.
-[Matt] Well done.

Well done.

I still feel in danger, because they both
said it was rough and ready, the finish.

Yes it was,
but it was finished nonetheless.

[Amanda] It's a mess.

Mine's the only one that's collapsed,

so I think the chances
of staying are slim.

[Maggie] I would give anything
to be here another week.

It's quite silly, really,

but when I've watched people
on Bake Off before, crying,

I've thought, "For goodness sake.
[chuckling] You know, it's only cake."

And suddenly it's all changed.

[chuckling] But everybody's
so much more skilful.

So, um, so we'll see, we'll see.

[Matt] It's decision time
for Prue and Paul.

Who will be named Star Baker

and whose time in the tent
will come to an end?

Week two, that was a pretty high
standard of Showstopper, wasn't it?

-That was great.
-[Prue] It really was.

I felt so sorry for Amanda.

If that rocking horse had held together,

it would've been right up there
because it tasted beautiful.

It was so delicate.

The one I'm most
worried about is Jairzeno.

You were looking at that going,
"It's kind of a ship."

Or a barge. He had a very leaky stern.

All his bakes have been rough and ready.

I think Jairzeno is in
a little bit of trouble, I agree.

And I would even put Maggie down there.

She struggled in the signature

and I wasn't convinced that that beach hut
was strong enough.

But I think, for me,
in line for Star Baker, JÃ¼rgen.

-[Prue] Yes, certainly.
-[Paul] Giuseppe's up there as well.

-[Prue] What about Chigs?
-I think Chigs has to be up there

because that snooker table is fantastic.

One of the names you didn't mention there
who did really well, I think, was George.

[Paul] George, I think,
sort of jumped up a bit.

[Prue] I love George
because I think he has real imagination,

and his concepts are always great.

-Yeah, they're really good.
-They're just sort ofâ¦

-[Noel] He's not very neat.
-â¦tatty at the edges.

I just had this thoughtâ¦

I mean, George grew up in Cyprus.
You were in Cyprus for a while.

You're probably, what, about 25 years
older than George?

You like the ladies. Do you feel
a sort of paternal sense towards him?

-Matt, this is going nowhere.
-Yeah. It's finished, don't worry.

Well, bakers, it falls to me to announce
who is the smartest cookie.

Do you see what I did there?
That was really good, wasn't it?

This week's Star Baker isâ¦

JÃ¼rgen.

[all applauding]

That means I've got the horrible job
of announcing who's going home.

This only gets harder
as we get to know you all,

but the person who's leaving us
this week isâ¦

Jairzeno.

Sorry, bro.

-You don't deserve to go, oh, God.
-Thank you.

-[Paul] Loved the idea, mate.
-Thank you.

I was half-expecting that result

because if you look at the Showstopper,
compared to everybody else's,

mine was quite basic.

-Oh, I'm so sad.
-[chuckles]

[sighs] I'm really relieved,

but I am absolutely gutted
that Jairzeno's gone.

We sit and talk all the time.
He's so lovely. He's so laid-back.

And his flavours are amazing.
I don't understand, wellâ¦

Someone has to go.

[Maggie] Amazing, I meanâ¦

But I think, this afternoon,

I learned the real meaning
of the little expression,

"The skin of your teeth."

[Prue] Well done, Giuseppe.
You really did good.

Thank you very much.

I've had a very, very good couple of days.
I'm very happy with how it went.

JÃ¼rgen deserved it entirely.
It's very stiff competition.

[Rochica] I'm so proud of you.

[line ringing]

I've got no plans
for stopping The Baking Terminator.

[Giuseppe laughs]

-Hello?
-Hi, Benjamin. This is JÃ¼rgen.

I'm Star Baker again.

-[Benjamin laughs] No way.
-Yes.

-[woman] JÃ¼rgen.
-[JÃ¼rgen] Yes.

-[woman] Is it true?
-It is true.

-[woman] My goodness.
-[chuckles]

-[woman laughs]
-Yeah, crazy, isn't it?

[closing theme playing]

This week it's time to bake bread, and the remaining bakers have a lot to prove. They put their own twist on a classic Italian focaccia in the Signature and head slightly further east in the technical, making a Greek inspired snack.
You're doing really well.
What are you using for bait?

-One of Prue's crusty baps.
-[chuckles]

Yeah, they love it.

I've just switched
to one of Paul's sourdoughs.

It's going to blow
the fishes' mind. [laughs]

Whoo!

-[fish] Ugh. Disgusting.
-Oh, dear.

[both] Welcome
to The Great British Baking Show.

[fish] Ooh, it's over-proved.

[Noel] Nowâ¦

[Freya] What a genuine nightmare.

â¦the bakers face Bread Weekâ¦

I think I can blag my way through it.

â¦and an irregular Signature.

-We're talking crumb structure.
-Yes.

[Freya] I don't really know
what I'm supposed to be looking at.

I don't know ifâ¦ I don't know. [laughs]

[Noel] A tricky, sticky Technicalâ¦

[Paul] There's a blind panic in this.

â¦and a spectacular milk bread Showstopper.

[George] It's falling.

All under the watchful eyes
of Prue and Paul.

God, it's major anxiety
when he's looking at you, isn't it?



I'm so over Bread Week. [chuckles]

[theme music playing]

[chattering indistinctly]

Shocked that I'm still here.
Terrified for Bread Week.

[Crystelle] Making bread
when Paul Hollywood is in the roomâ¦

[laughs] I'm not looking forward to this.

[George] I find it unnerving
Paul Hollywood staring at me anyway,

so Bread Week is, like, extra, like,
"Oh, God. He's here."

[Giuseppe] I should feel comfortable
because bread and pizza is what I do.

But when I do it at home,
it takes a couple of days,

[chuckling] whereas doing it in a couple
of hours is very challenging.

Bakers, welcome back to the tent
for Bread Week.

Yeah, it's bread week. I'm so excited.
Do you know who else is excited?

Paul Hollywood.

You know Michael Flatley
is Lord of the Dance.

Well, Paul is Lord of the Loaf.

âª Bread, bread, wherever you may be
I am the Lord of the Loaf, said he âª

âª And my arms are naans
And my head's a chapati âª

âª I am the Lord of the Loaf, said he âª

[Noel] For your Signature challenge,

the judges would like you to make
a perfectly baked focaccia.

You can make your focaccia in any style
you like or any flavour you like.

It needs to have a crispy crust and also
an open, irregular crumb structure.

-You have no idea what that means, do you?
-[laughs] Not at all.

You just say what they tell you
to say, don't you?

Yeah.

-[Matt] You have two hours and 45 minutes.
-On your marksâ¦

-Get setâ¦
-Dance!

We're making Italian bread.
It doesn't get more Italian than focaccia.

That's why I feel a lot of pressure on me.

[George] Hopefully, it all comes together.

Or it might be a disaster,
but let's hope that it's not.

[Paul] It's Bread Week,
and for the Signature bake,

we've challenged the bakers
to make a beautiful focaccia.

[Prue] The outside must be crusty,

and the inside has to be soft
with an open crumb

but rather irregular sort of big
and little holes, but quite loose.

The bakers should understand that you need
a lot of water in a focaccia.

If they don't put a lot of water in,
it will be very cake-y.

Done, done, done.

After its second rise,
you have to poke little dimples in it.

And that's where
they can introduce flavours.

Whether it's tomatoes, olives, rosemary,
garlic, it's entirely up to them.

Keep it simple. Stick to what you know
when you don't know nothing. [laughs]

Morning, Giuseppe.

-Good morning. Good morning.
-Hello, Giuseppe.

Tell us all about your focaccia.

My focaccia is called Breakfast in Gaeta

because it reminds me of the breakfast
I used to have in Gaeta, my hometown,

with my grandmother.

These olives have been
flown back from Gaeta,

so they are the ones
that are harvested in my hometown.

And the oil has been made
by my father-in-law.

Sounds lovely.

[Matt] Alongside
his imported olives and olive oil,

Giuseppe's focaccia will include
one other unique ingredient.

In terms of liquid,
I've got a mix of water and milk.

Milk in focaccia.
Is that what your grandmother did?

No, not at all.
My grandmother used to buy her bread.

-[laughter]
-Rather than making it.

[Noel] Another baker sticking
with Italian flavoursâ¦

[Maggie] Ooh! Love olives.

-[laughs]
-â¦is Maggie.

A traditional flavour's traditional
because it was good in the first place.

So I'm staying
with traditional taste throughout this.

[Noel] Sun-dried and cherry tomatoes,
basil, and garlic

will top Maggie's
thyme-flavoured focaccia.

I'm using a strong bread flour
with a bit of yeast, a little bit of salt,

and flavouring with a little bit of thyme.

And that's it, really.

[Noel] While Maggie's
sticking to tradition,

Lizzie is combining
her famously-simple Italian breadâ¦

Put truffle oil in the dough.

[Noel] â¦with a taste of the high lifeâ¦

Race day in Liverpool, in Aintree,

uh, me and me family
drink a lot of champagne

and just eat a lot of carbs.

So it's truffle and garlic confit.

I mean, this is sort of
peasant bread for a prince.

-Yeah, well, I wasn't paying, soâ¦
-[laughter]

-Give me all of it, yeah?
-Bring it on. Bring it on.

[Matt] Her rich truffle focaccia

will be laced with truffle oil,
garlic and rosemary

and topped with rich black truffle.

-Do you like making bread?
-No.

-Why not?
-'Cause it's horrible.

-You don't know what it's thinking, do ya?
-What? Bread? [laughs]

-You don'tâ¦
-[Noel] Don't know what bread's thinking?

-No.
-"Don't eat me."

That's what bread's thinking.
And can you stop putting me in the oven?

[Matt] Going in the reigning
two-time Star Baker's oven

are far more humble British ingredients.

The focaccia is called kipper-caccia.

-A what?
-Kipper-caccia.

Kipper-caccia?

Yes, I thought, when I moved to England,
"What did I like about British cuisine?"

I really like kippers.

[Matt] JÃ¼rgen will be hoping
his unusual flavours

of kippers, tarragon and boiled eggs
will help him retain the Star Baker crown.

If you win Star Baker again,

-it's going to be demoralising.
-[both laughing]

They're just going to be like,
"Right, I'm out. I've had enough."

You know, it would get boring.

If you do that, next year,
you'll be standing there instead of Paul.

-You and Prue, the judges.
-I won't comment.

-And then Paul will be doing my job.
-[both laughing]

That would be something, yeah.

[Matt] To achieve the trademark open crumb
Paul and Prue are expectingâ¦

-[JÃ¼rgen] Ooh!
-â¦the bakers must wrestle

with a dough that requires more liquid
than most other breads.

You always think
that it is just too wet and sticky,

but in fact, it does come together.

You just have to have faith.

I'm grimacing 'cause my arm's aching.

[Matt] Amanda also has her work cut out
with her meze-style ingredients.

My toppings today are going to be olives,
red peppers, stuffed with garlic,

cream cheese and herbs,
some feta cheese and some garlic as well,

so quite a lot of topping on there.
Bit Mediterranean.

[Matt] Her meze-style focaccia
will feature a lattice

to help arrange
her numerous toppings into neat lines.

[Amanda] I love meze. I love picking.

But you know what they say.
Girls who are pickers wear big knickers.

It's true.

Been kneading for ten minutes
and it feels like an hour.

I think I need to get this
in the proving bowl.

This is just going to go into
the proving drawer for 45 minutes.

About an hour for the first prove.

[oven timers beeping]

[Noel] As the proving beginsâ¦

It's like a symphony of alarms, isn't it?

â¦the bakers can turn their attention
to the all-important flavours.

-[Lizzie] This is some truffle.
-[Chigs] Fancy bugger!

-You got truffle salt as well?
-Yeah.

Oh, that smells delicious.

[Giuseppe] So I'm adding
balsamic vinegar to my onions now,

hoping to drag you back to Italy
with my flavours today.

[Noel] Aiming to cook up a slice
of Mediterranean rivalryâ¦

[George] This is how we do it in Cyprus.
Don't worry about the Italians.

â¦is George.

Topped with onion, parsley,
olives and halloumi cheese,

George's dough will have a hint
of mint and cherry kernel,

but he's opted to go easy
on one key ingredient.

So I didn't use all my water
'cause it just wasn't necessary.

You're freaking me out, Paul.

You're not gonna give me
any indication?

-Nope.
-[Prue] Don't let him freak you out.

-Okay.
-[Paul] I love the sound of flavours.

Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.

Is it too late to add some water?

-Don't ask me. I have no idea.
-Okay.

I'm thinking the dough
needed to be wetter.

I'm going again.
Paul's face didn't look right.

So I'm going to do two.
I'm gonna see how they look.

And I'm gonna go
with which one rises better.

[sniffs] Oh, I smell garlic.

[Rochica] I do want them to taste
the garlic the most,

which I'm sure they will,
because I did when I tried it.

[Matt] Aiming to pack a punch
with her fully-loaded focaccia is Rochica.

I've got tomatoes,
feta with honey and black pepper,

spring onions, red onions and basil.

All spice and roasted garlic
inside the dough.

-There's a lot going on with this one.
-Yeah.

[Matt] Her plentiful toppings
will form a floral design

atop a garlic-packed focaccia.

[Noel] Do you make this at home?

-No?
-Not really, no.

Say yes to the camera.
Do you make this at home?

-Yes, I make it at home.
-All the time.

-All the time.
-And you're Italian, right?

I am, yes.

And you were brought up
by a Giuseppe in Italy?

[laughs]

[grunts]

I think this is better.
I just want it to hurry up.

-Something's bugging me.
-Yeah?

Why is this cupcake all on its own?

-Well, this cupcake's isolatingâ¦
-Is it?

-â¦for four days.
-Yeah?

And it's going to get tested
and join these guys down here.

Oh, lovely.

-If all goes well.
-All goes well.

Bakers, you are halfway through!

Oh, my God.

-[alarm beeping]
-Time to take these out.

I mean, I can see some little bubbles
in the bottom

which, apparently, is a good sign.

[Matt] The bakers must now
carefully shape their dough

before a second prove.

Like a gentle baby.

[Matt] If they knock out too much air nowâ¦

It can be quite stubborn,
so you've got to encourage it to move.

â¦they'll lose
the distinctive focaccia bubbles

formed in the first proveâ¦

My cat does this to me at home.

â¦and end up with tight, dense bread.

I'm adding my onions now.

[Matt] It's also another chance
to pack in more flavourâ¦

Get the garlic, spreading it on.

â¦to win over the judges.

Gonna let it prove now.

Stop trying to stare my bread out.
It's gonna win, it's got no eyes.

God, it's major anxiety
when he's looking at you, isn't it?

Just going to leave this
in here for about 45 minutes.

[timer beeping]

Who knows if this is even right?

Whilst that's proving, I'll carry on
with my toppings and fillings.

[Freya] Just made up
my version of Fajita spice.

Not too spicy
'cause I don't like spicy food.

I love Fajitas.

My family eat Fajitas
every week, like religiously.

[Matt] Freya's fiery family favourites

will be flavouring
her less familiar focaccia bread.

Do you not make bread?

No, I don't make bread.
I think it's a bit of a faff.

-[chuckles]
-You know?

-Tell everyone what you called me earlier.
-[chuckles]

You do look a lot like Where's Wally.

-[Noel] Where's Wally?
-[chuckling]

Yeah, you are giving off that vibe.

-[chuckling]
-[chuckling] Not in a bad way.

My roasted grapes look all right. [coughs]

[Noel] Rather than tried-and-tested
flavour combinations,

Crystelle has decided to try something
for the very first time.

I once had
roasted grapes on holiday with Feta.

And I really liked the salty
and the sweet combination.

And I thought,
why not do it on some focaccia?

I don't know if Paul thinks it's a thing.
He might not.

Scary stuff, really. [chuckling]

[Noel] Crystelle
is flavouring with walnuts,

feta and roasted grapes
and a topping of fresh fennel.

-[Matt] How's it going?
-[Crystelle] I don't like saying "well,"

'cause I'll only know
when Paul cuts into it

and tells me it's raw, that it's fine.

What about Prue,
or does her word not count?

No, it does. Her words do count a lot.

-To be honest--
-[Matt] You can say what you like.

-She doesn't watch this show. No.
-Does she not?

[Noel] Also taking inspiration
from his favourite holiday flavoursâ¦

Today I am making
a Spanish-inspired focaccia.

â¦is Chigs.

I go to Spain quite a bit
and I love the food.

What's not to like?
Chorizo sausage and cheese.

Amazing combo.

[Noel] His Spanish-styled focaccia

will be based in
a garlic-and-thyme-infused oil

and feature chorizo, manchego cheese
and spicy piquante peppers.

-I'd like to congratulate you.
-Okay?

You are the first person
in the history of this show

-to make invisible bread.
-Oh, wow.

-[Chigs] Want to taste a bit?
-[Matt] Yes, please.

[Chigs] What can you taste?

What would Hollywood say,

[mimicking Paul]
"I couldn't really taste theâ¦ the bread."

[chuckling]

I need it in the oven in eight minutes.

No matter what it is, it's going in.

How long have we got?

[speaking French]

[in English] half hour.

-[chuckling] So sexy!
-Thank you.

[Rochica] Good God!

[George] I want it to hurry up.

It's looking good. It's proven enough.

Waiting around is torturing me right now.

So now,
I'm finally putting my toppings on.

[Matt] If the bakers don't add
the distinctive focaccia dimplesâ¦

[Rochica] You have to press to the bottom.
Don't be scared to get all the way in.

â¦the dough will rise
too quickly in the ovenâ¦

[Maggie] You can just
put random little holes in.

â¦and the toppings
won't stick to the bread.

These are my pride and joy.
They are small bombs of flavour.

[Amanda] I'm doing them
in lines like that.

So if someone
doesn't like feta, you can just avoid.

I'm just spreading it out
so, you know, it's not uneven.

Then I'm gonna bake.

[Crystelle] Come on, be good to me.
Please be good to me.

I'm going in for 18 minutes,
and it should be perfectly done by then.

I'm going to put it on the bottom shelf
and bake it for a bit longer.

I'll do ten minutes on 240
and then turn it down.

Temperature sets the crust.
Time sets the crumb.

-[Noel] You all right?
-[George] I have to redo my dough.

-[Noel] Why?
-It wasn't wet enough.

[Noel] Crazy, this baking.

Too wet, not wet enough.
How long do you have to put it in for?

-Depends how wet it is.
-I know.

[both laugh]

-I meanâ¦ Bread.
-Oh, man!

I would love to prove this a bit longer,
but I'm going in.

This is the time everybody
in Bake Off starts looking in their oven.

At home, I've never looked in my oven.

[Giuseppe] Not thinking
of anything other than the focaccia.

If this tent collapses,
I probably won't notice. [laughs]

[Freya] I don't know
what I should be looking at.

I don't know if itâ¦ I don't know if I'mâ¦

I don't know. [chuckles]

-Should be regular, but open.
-Should be regular.

-Uh, yeah?
-Open.

-We're talking crumb structure.
-Yes.

-This hasn't happened before.
-[chuckles]

What's happened to me? I used to be funny.

[both laughing]

You just have to go with timings.
Timing and a bit of feel.

Just don't want it to brown too much.

Butchers, you have five minutes left.

Did he says butchers?

-Bakers.
-Oh, damn.

Don't panic, don't panic.

[timer beeping]

[groans]

Please let it be all right. There we go!

Okay, that's got a nice crust on it.

[Giuseppe] Looks done.

It looks dark, but it's, like, not huge.

-[timer beeping]
-That's me. Time's up.

Everyone else's is out
and mine's still in.

This is just truffle oil.

I'll give it a few minutes
in the tin and tip it out onto that.

[Crystelle] Bit of fresh fennel going on.

Do you know how long we've got?

Bakers, you have one minute remaining.

-Did he say one minute?
-Yeah.

[groans]

Come on, get out. Get out! [chuckles]

It's just too much stress,
isn't it, really?

Try and get that under there
without ripping it.

-The dreaded flip!
-Come on, go, go, go, yeah!

Bakers, your time is up!

Oh, my mum! [chuckles]

[Matt] Please step away from your bakes.

Crystelle!

-[chuckles]
-Bit childish, but, you know, still cute.

We don't have
big bubbles sticking out also,

but we don't know until we cut into it.

Ay, ay, ay.

[Noel] The bakers'
Signature focaccia breads

now face the judgment of Paul and Prue.

-Hello, George.
-Hello.

[Paul] I know you did the dough again.

-Is this your second or your first?
-Second.

[Paul] It's packed
and I like that in a focaccia.

Sort of busy.

-[Prue] I think that's lovely, George.
-Thank you.

The bake is good. You created a good blend
of flavours all the way through.

You just needed a little bit
more water to open it up a bit more.

But I think you're sort of
85% of the way there.

And you were definitely right
to redo the dough.

Yeah.

[Prue] Looks very attractive.

[Paul] It's gotta be pushed down
till you feel the tray.

-[Maggie] Oh, right.
-That far down.

I like that stretchy soft texture.

It's very soft on the top,
which defeats the object a little bit.

But I do like the flavours.
I love the thyme in there.

Maybe a little bit more mixing.

-But overall, it's a decent focaccia.
-Thank you. [chuckles]

[Paul] This smells great.

The texture's nice.

I get the pepper and the cayenne
in there, little hint of paprika.

It's well baked.

I'm really relieved,

because I thought it was going
to be over-spiced and it's not.

-It's really delicately done.
-Ah, thank you!

[Paul] Love the design on the top
like you've scorched it.

-Wow.
-[Prue] That's all garlic.

-Strong, isn't it?
-Yeah. [laughs]

The texture is okay.
The problem is it's very strong of garlic.

I would have put the garlic on the top,
pushed it in.

In this piece there isn't any,
but loads in this one.

It's about keeping it all regular.

Let's ask the vampire
what you think of that.

Yeah, I can't go near that. [chuckling]

-[Paul] He backs away from it as well.
-[chuckling]

It's overbaked.
Needed to come out five minutes before.

-You put the filling in lines, didn't you?
-Yeah.

[Prue] Think I prefer it scattered
so you get a bit of everything.

If you'd put less flavours,
one of everything in one bite,

then you'd have smashed it.

Thank you.

When you put cheese on like this,
you end up with a dry spot,

and then you're going to have
exposed areas of dough.

And that'll always catch.
So what you've done is over-baked this.

-The flavours are lovely. Really powerful.
-[Chigs] Yeah?

-Great flavours there.
-It's delicious.

It's quite an open structure,
but it needed to be much, much thicker.

That's beautiful, annoyingly thin.

-Okay.
-It needed to be a little bit thicker.

And that was beautiful.
Great flavour combination.

And it's so unusual because it's so fresh.

Highly unusual, but beautiful.

-Well done.
-[Paul] Thank you.

[sighs] Thank you!

[Prue] It looks really nice.

[Paul] It's got a nice top,
it's fairly equal.

You've filled the tin quite nicely.

I think it's lovely. Good flavour,
nice and soft, crisp on the outside.

You could've proved it a little bit longer
just to open it up a little bit more,

but you have an irregular
structure with a crispy top

and a fantastic flavour and colour,
so I can't fault it that much.

-I think it's a great focaccia.
-Ta.

-[Paul] It's slightly over-baked.
-Mmm-hmm.

[Paul] You have a big wet spot
that runs down there along the base.

More proving and less baking.

It's quite tight inside.
It needed more mixing.

It does break pretty easily.
It's more cake-like than bread-like.

JÃ¼rgen, I'm not absolutely mad
about the flavours.

I normally love kippers.

I just think it could have been
a little bit better.

It's the sort of focaccia
that I would bake,

-but let's have a look inside, shall we?
-Yes.

It's really nice. It's soft,
and yet it's got the focaccia structure.

[Paul] Shows it's proved correctly.

But the thing that I particularly like,
you haven't gone overboard with flavour.

And made a beautifully light focaccia.

And you get a mouthful
of everything on every bite.

-That's what focaccia is.
-Thank you.

I think it's beautiful. Well done.

[all applauding]

[Prue] Are you all right, Giuseppe?
[laughs]

[Paul] So this is your recipe,
and you must give it to me.

-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

-[whispers] Well done! Nice!
-Wow.

[both exhale in relief]

[Giuseppe whispering indistinctly]

[Giuseppe] I got a little emotional
because I never thought I would get one.

I was expecting a "but" there,
so you knowâ¦

"But this is wrong.
But you should have done this different."

[Crystelle] I'm quite okay with that.
"Annoyingly thin."

But I don't mind being annoyingly thin.

Considering I started again,
things turned out pretty well.

[JÃ¼rgen] This time,
it didn't go 100% well.

Paul and Prue certainly
have high standards.

And having had two Star Bakers,
they're expecting things.

But it's not a tragedy.

[Noel] The Bakers
could practise their focaccia,

but have no idea what awaits them
in the Technical challenge.

Welcome back, bakers.

It's Bread week, so obviously,
Paul's set your Technical challenge today.

Paul, any words of advice?

It's a fairly complicated recipe,
but be careful how you add the filling.

As ever, this task is judged blind.

So Paul and Prue,
if you'd like to leave the tent.

Bye-bye. We will miss you.

For your Technical challenge,

Paul would like you each

to make a batch of 15 olive and cheese
ciabatta breadsticks.

Your ciabatta breadsticks have to have
that classic ciabatta holey texture

with an even distribution
of cheese and olives.

They should be served
alongside a tzatziki dip.

Noel, do you have anything
amusing to say about tzatziki?

Funny you should ask, Matthew,

because I peered into
Prue's dressing room earlier,

and Paul was on his knees,

rubbing tzatziki into Prue's feet
while she was asleep. [chuckles]

-Really?
-Yeah.

Did that happen?

I don't know. How am I supposed to know
what's real life and what's a dream?

Well, what do you think this is?
Is this real or a dream?

This is definitely a nightmare.

Yeah. Yeah, I used to be in films.

Okay. You have two hours.

-On your marksâ¦
-[sing-song] Get setâ¦

Bake!

What a genuine nightmare.

Never made ciabatta,
never made breadsticks.

And never made ciabatta breadsticks.

I think I can blag my way through it.

I think. We will see.

Bread knowledge bomb. [mimics explosion]

[chuckles]

[Paul] So we're looking for
a gorgeous ciabatta stick,

obviously all the same size
and the same colour.

Nice and brown.

Too pale, they'll just flop.

Ciabatta. It's a very soft dough.
Quite tricky to work with.

-You're trying to keep the air in.
-[Paul] Yeah. They gotta be careful.

-[cracking]
-[Prue] Have that ciabatta rip.

[Paul] If you look inside,
you see a beautiful open structure.

-It's full of cheese. It's full of olives.
-Mmm.

Heaven.

Now we have an Italian in the tent.

He will know what ciabatta is,

but is he wise enough
to be able to produce these sticks?

He'll be rather carrying the flag
for his country, won't he? [chuckles]

I've never made ciabatta bread.
So this is gonna be an interesting one.

[Maggie] "Make the dough."

What could be simpler than that?

Six hundred grams of water,
750 grams of flour.

It's 80% hydration, this dough,
so it's gonna be very wet and sticky.

The mix is kind of just
letting it swill about.

Oh, golly gosh,
that cannot be good, can it?

Starting to slapâ¦

As we say a schiaffeggiare,
as we say in Italian.

So when the dough slaps
against the faces of the bowl,

that's a good sign
that it's coming together.

[Freya] And I thought focaccia
was a wet dough.

This is just water.

Number two is, "Add olives,
manchego, onion and coriander."

-Are you a fan of breadsticks?
-[Crystelle] Not really.

Food you only eat
when you're really hungry.

-Am I right?
-Yeah, it's a waste of time.

I completely agree.

This task is a waste of time!

As you were. Carry on.

I'm contemplating
whether to chop the olives

or just to leave them.

I am putting my olives in whole.

I'll go with that, otherwise the whole
olive will be as thick as the breadstick.

I was gonna put it on the bench,
but I feel like it's too sticky.

-Erâ¦
-You all right?

Looks like I'm dealing
with troll bogies, doesn't it?

Who eats a breadstick?

-Who?
-I don't mind a breadstick.

[laughs]

Something wrong with you then.

I'm quite working class,

so I didn't know
what a breadstick was until I was 18.

Uh, number three says, "Prove."

[George] Get in there, you lovely boy.

-I'm going to beâ¦
-[timer beeping]

â¦on the safe side
and only leave them 20 minutes.

It's faster and I need fast.

I'd ideally like to prove for an hour
but I might cut it short.

Surely ciabatta in two hours
is not normal.

[sighs] Bake Off isn't normal, is it?

[chuckling]

-[laughs]
-[Amanda] There he is.

[both laughing]

Bakers, you are halfway through!

-Well done.
-No, I haven't finished.

â¦ooh. Right, now I'm finished.

[chuckling] He might be.

And now, I'm gonna make the tzâ¦
Whatever that thing is.

[George] Tzatziki. If I get this wrong,

I won't be able to set foot
in Cyprus again.

I'm grating cucumbers to drain them.

You don't get taught that in school.

You put a condom on a cucumber in school,
you don't grate them.

[George] Done.

This will mean nothing
if the bread sticks don't turn out.

-There's the onions.
-[Noel] Oh, you forgot the onions.

-Forgot the onions.
-Can't you open that andâ¦ [whooshes]

No, because it's half-proved.

[Noel] What are you going to do,
how're you going to play it?

I'm not going to worry.

[Matt] Judging how long
to leave their dough

for the first prove is critical.

I just think it is not ready.

[Matt] Too short a prove,

and it won't develop
the crucial open structure.

I'm just gonnaâ¦ I'm just gonnaâ¦
I'm just gonna leave myself five minutes.

[Matt] Too long and they risk
running out of time to bake.

I just don't want to rush
this first prove.

Is your mum an amazing cook?

-Uh, my dad is.
-Your dad's an amazing cook.

Mum is more of an amazing eater.

[laughing]

She's the taster.

The truth is, you probably know
more about bread than Paul.

[grunts] That's a bold statement.

I just said that.

[Chigs] Well, that looks decent.

It has risen.
You can see lots of bubbles all around.

"Cut the dough into 15 sticks,
approximately 35 centimetres long,

and place onto three prepared
baking trays."

[George] No, manâ¦
I don't know what I'm doing.

I know they're
supposed to be in stick form,

so that's good, that's in the name.

Approximately 35 centimetres,
which is hella long.

God, it can't be 35.

It's not even gonna fit on the, erâ¦
Oh, the other way, Freya. Sick.

[Amanda] That one's 35. Now. [chuckles]

That's going to be a bit thin.
So don't tell him that one.

Paul and Prue make a bit of an issue
if they think sizes don't match.

I know,
but these are not in a supermarket.

They're in a Greek taverna.

-They won't fall for that.
-[chuckles]

[Giuseppe] I'm hoping that,
by twisting them,

I can keep the ingredients in better.

-[Noel] You all right?
-Yeah.

-Yeah?
-Yeah, I'm learning counting.

-[chuckling] Learning counting?
-Yeah.

It's probably a bit late now.

-[Noel] Do you need this?
-No, you can eat it.

-[dough smacks]
-[gasps]

[both laughing]

Oh, my God!

-Stop it!
-Yeah. [laughs]

Was that you? JÃ¼rgen, I didn't know
you had that in you.

[Chigs] Come on. Second prove.

Give 'em as long to prove as possible.

[Lizzie] How do you get 'em in these bags?

Bakers, you are half an hour away
from victory, tragedy or comedy.

Or maybe all three.

I think I'm going to go
for, like, eight more minutes,

and then I'm going
to stick them in the oven.

The proof is very key, but given
the time restriction on this challenge,

ermâ¦

I'll do two 30-minute proofs,
which is very, very little.

So when you're home
and you're proving stuff, what do you do?

Er, read, maybe go for a run.

Wow. You definitely
haven't got children, have you?

-No, hell no.
-[chuckles]

Reading. Let me think, I remember that.
Going for a run.

Hang on.
I'm just going back into the archives.

Oh, yeah, I remember that.

There it is, look, one word. "Bake."

Okay, I'm just going in.

[Giuseppe] It's high temperature, 220.
I'm hoping that twenty minutes is enough.

[Amanda] I'm going to go for 12,

and then I'll have a look halfway
and see how they are.

[sighs]

I'll keep this in for a bit longer.

[Rochica] I haven't shaped them
all at the same time.

So I don't want
to put them all in at the same time.

-[timer beeping]
-I'm gonna do ten minutes at first

and then check them.

It will be what it is.

[Crystelle] Has everyone
put theirs in the oven?

Good. Just me.

I don't know if I'm doing this right,
but I feel like long proof, short bake.

[Freya] Don't even know
how long breadsticks usually take.

I just don't want them to be raw.

Bakers, you have 15 hours left.

-Minutes.
-[in silly accent] Same difference.

Maybe I'll just put them in.
Please be good to me, please.

Okay, that's fine.

We should bake
on a "bread" setting at 220.

[gasps] Oh. Turning it up a little bit.

Okay, so it says, "bread oven, 220."
So I've set my oven to 220 now.

There's no point opening the oven door,

I'm just gonna let cold air in.
They're not cooked yet.

They're not overcooked.

Let's turn the oven up.

They're looking out at me. Olive eyes.

[chuckling]

[Rochica] Take those ones out,
'cause there's like cheese,

I don't want to over-bake them.

How long have we got left?

Bakers, you have five minutes
remaining in this task.

You will then have to end the task.

Once that's happened,
then obviously the task will be over.

And then there'll be some judging and--

-You got four minutes left.
-[laughs]

Should I take them out?

They're still a bit blonde.

Perhaps I should put the grill on.

They take surprisingly long.

So I think it's good I went in when I did.

Come on.

I need to get a wriggle on.

So over Bread Week.

Oh, Giuseppe, yours are browning nicely.

I think that the top tray is done.

So I'm taking this out.

Oh, they look baked. God knows.

I was just so confident
they would bake in 15 minutes.

-Too late.
-Bakers, you have one minute left.

[Freya] "One minute"?
This is just rather wild.

[Rochica] Oh, mine are terrible.

Breadstick Jenga.

That's what everyone
wants to be playing right now.

It's just now or never, really.

-[Giuseppe sighs]
-Where's my scissors?

-[Crystelle] Just tell me I can do it.
-[Lizzie] You have got this right now.

[Giuseppe] Come on, come on, come on.

-[sighs]
-[Crystelle] Come on, come on, come on.

Bakers, your time is up.

Oh God, what a nightmare.

Please bring your bakes to the front
and place them behind your photograph.

Mine are going to be raw. Oh, God.

That is a lot of carbs.

Oh, all right. Paul hates raw things.

Oh God! Nightmare.

[Matt] Paul and Prue are looking
for 18 well-filled ciabatta breadsticks

with an open structure
and a crisp brown crust,

served with an unctuous tzatziki dip.

[scattered laughter]

-There's a few here that look good.
-Hmm.

[Paul] Now theseâ¦

-They're like snakes.
-They're a little bit sad.

Not long enough in the oven.

You want them to be open-structured
and crispy on the outside,

so it's a bit bready, but it tastes good.

They're slightly up and down in shape.

Yeah, they are. Bit irregular.

-Nice tzatziki, though.
-[Prue] That's good stuff.

Mmm. It is. These are better.
The bread's good. It's crispy.

Nice to see the olives whole as well.
They got a bit of a stronger bake.

They need a little bit longer,
but there's a couple good ones.

You've lost a lot of the air
when it's been cut.

-Very odd shape too.
-[Paul] Longer in the oven.

-[Prue] The bread flavour's good.
-And more careful with the stretching.

Now these are too small, and then you get
that rigidity in there as well.

But it needed to be longer.
We're testing for their bread skills.

This almost looks like it's been rolled.

It's quite tight inside,
it's not really open at all.

[Prue] Slightly more colour
and crispness on it.

[Paul] Got no onions in it.

-It misses it actually. It needs it.
-Mmm. Move on to the next one.

Shape-wise, they're good.
It's just the colour. They needed longer.

Does taste good.

-[Paul] Tzatziki's nice.
-[Prue] Mmm.

Moving on, these are all
very pale, and flat.

-[Prue] And raw.
-[Paul] And raw.

-Every one of them.
-[Prue chuckles]

All the cheese has come out here.

Yeah.

There's a blind panic in this.
They haven't been in the oven long enough.

-Either that or the oven wasn't hot--
-Or it wasn't on.

[Prue chuckles]

This one also looks a bit underdone.

I know that it's a rustic dish,

but I'd feel cheated
if I got this one and you got this one.

[Paul] The flavour's nice though.

They need to be a bit more
uniform than that.

[Paul] Now these don't look too bad.

-[Prue] The colour's better.
-That's pretty good.

-[Prue] It's holding its shape.
-You see whole olives all the way through.

Structure's better.

-It's nice though.
-Yeah, they're quite strong.

I like that one.

-Same issue again?
-Underdone.

[Paul] Run out of time.

[breathes deeply]
[chuckling] That smell is so lovely.

-[Paul] You got a bit of, erâ¦
-[Prue] Flour all over me.

[Paul] Over your nose.

-I was kissing it.
-Oh, right.

Kissing it better.

-[Paul] Massively under-baked.
-[Prue] Yeah.

It's a shame. Flavour's all right, though.

Now, theseâ¦ Looks like it's been twisted.

[Prue] It's been twisted a bit, hasn't it?
But that looks quite nice.

[Paul] It's quite effective.
It's got a nice colour.

[crunches]

Delicious. You can taste the crust,

with the caramelization on the outside,
which is key.

Wow. Okay. This will be interesting.

[Noel] Paul and Prue will now rank
the breadsticks from worst to first.

Tenth place is this one.

Rochica. A little bit raw,
and badly shaped, really.

In ninth, we have this one. Whose is this?

What were you thinking?

I was like, long prove, short bake.

-And I was clearly wrong.
-[Paul] Short bake?

I apologize. Yeah.

In eighth place, we've got this one.

-Whose is this?
-Mine.

Maggie, what happened to the onion?

The onions, I forgot to put in.

[Noel] George is seventh.
Chigs comes sixth.

In fifth is JÃ¼rgen.

-And Freya takes fourth.
-Me.

In third, we have this one. Whose is this?

Just a little bit longer in the oven,
and you would have been there.

All comes down to the colour.

And in second place, we have this one.

Lizzie, they were absolutely lovely.

Just one or two of them were a bit soft.

In first place, we haveâ¦

It's got a good colour on it,
it's got a nice flavour to it.

And I think they're a pretty good bread.

[all cheering]

An Italian making ciabatta.

Who would have thought it, eh?
Who would have thought it?

First place. Can you believe that? Yeah?

Bread, there are so many things
that can go wrong.

Every time it's a bit of a gamble, really.

You know what you put in.
You never know what you get out.

They've been having some happy tea
or something in the back there.

Off their heads. Think mine's second.

It's definitely a long prove
and a short bake.

Like I was so sure of it.

Erm, and clearly, I was so wrong.

[groans] I'm so rubbish at Technicals.
I just don't understand.

-It's a surprise to me that--
-You're on a baking show. [laughs]

-Yeah, who knew?
-[Noel] Same.

[Matt] Star baker, week one,
star baker, week two,

and he might be looking into the abyss
week three, JÃ¼rgen.

I think JÃ¼rgen's
in a little bit of trouble.

-But it is all to play for.
-Who really needs to up their game?

-[Paul] Maggie and Rochica.
-[Matt] Right.

[Paul] Chigs-ish.
He's sort of middle, but could float down.

What about Giuseppe,
of course, who's from Italy?

-And who's smashing it.
-[Paul] Well, heâ¦

I think the two challenges
played in his favour.

I never thought I'd see a grown lady
pick up a breadstick and kiss it.

I know. Well, I really love bread.

-[laughter]
-Andâ¦ And I likeâ¦

But that's taking it too far, Prue.

Come on, you must've kissed

-a piece of bread before.
-Come on. You've kissed a bap.

-Never in my life.
-Never kissed a loaf?

-[Paul] No!
-A bap?

-Why? What for?
-[Noel] Muffin?

I bet you've stroked a croissant.

That's different.

-You're dead inside.
-[all laughing]

Bakers, welcome back to the tent
for your Showstopper challenge.

Today, the judges would like you to make
a theme display using milk bread.

Never heard of milk bread.

I never heard of bread
until I just said it.

Your milk bread displays
need to be three-dimensional

and the shape and decoration
need to reflect your chosen theme.

[Matt] The judges would like you
to create a bread that is soft inside,

has a light and tender crust,
and is slightly sweet in flavour.

This is the Showstopper, so, like Prue,
it needs to be visually stunningâ¦

-And right tasty.
-[Noel] You have four and a half hours.

-[Matt] On your marksâ¦
-[sing-song] Get setâ¦

Bake.

Milk bread just means that you replace
the water content in the dough with milk.

[Giuseppe] You do find milk bread
in Italian cuisine as well,

but it's usually very small buns
that they use for party food.

Slightly sweet and filled also
with savoury fillings.

[Paul] The bakers
can choose any theme they wish,

but milk bread is notorious
for being a little bit smooth,

and avoiding those sharp edges,
so they're going to have to think of this.

What are they going to use
inside their dough?

It's entirely up to them.

Double cream as well as milk.

I'm using whole milk,
and I'm also using milk powder.

I think this is a really
exciting challenge.

People don't make milk bread enough.
It's a wonderful loaf.

So I'm excited to see
what they do with it.

If you can turn out focaccia and ciabatta,

you jolly well ought to be able
to turn out a milk loaf.

-Hello, Maggie.
-[Maggie] Good morning.

Tell us about your Showstopper display.

I'm staying with my theme of the beach.

It's going to be an octopus
sitting in a rock pool.

And the flavourâ¦

I'm hoping you've never tried before,
it's actually seaweed.

I've had seaweed bread.

-Have you?
-Yeah.

[laughs] I thought you might've.

[Matt] Six tablespoons of dulse seaweed
will flavour Maggie's rock pool octopus,

which will be decorated with royal icing.

I'm using plain flour.

No extra salt,
because the seaweed is so salty anyway.

And the whole of the liquid
is going to be milk.

Golly.

And today, my mantra is
a bit more concentration, less chatting.

-And seaweed.
-I'll leave you to it.

-Maggie, that might be hard for you.
-[all laughing]

[Matt] And Maggie isn't the only baker
looking to marine life for inspiration.

Maggie, when you were preparing for this,

how many tentacles did you think
an octopus had?

I made it with six legs.

-[chuckles]
-[Amanda] A sexy-pus.

[giggling]

[Matt] Amanda will be showcasing

the natural sweetness
of her milk bread octopus

alongside cinnamon shells

and hermit crabs of coconut crÃ¨me pat
and mango puree.

[Amanda] I thought of coconut and mango

'cause they're kind of
pina colada flavours.

And when I think of the sea,
I think of holidays.

And they do go well in bread.

[Matt] And Freya is giving
her sea creatures a vegan twist.

[Freya] I'm using soya milk
instead of whole milk,

and then instead of milk powder,
I'm using dry coconut milk powder,

so you don't actually
taste the coconut milk.

But I think it works really well.

[Matt] Freya's seascape will see
a hazelnut praline-filled crab

and marzipan starfish
sat either side of its centrepiece:

a chocolate-filled tear-and-share turtle.

-Oh, very vegan.
-[Freya laughs]

Freya said she could beat me
in an arm wrestle.

-All right, go on, then.
-[Freya] You'll get me in trouble.

Put your elbow on the bench.

-Oh, I'm nervous.
-Right, hook up, you ready?

-Waitâ¦
-[Paul] So when I release, you go.

-[Freya] Butâ¦
-All right? Go.

No! No! No!

-Come on, Freya! Come on, Freya!
-Come on, Freya!

[laughter]

-Oh, there we go.
-[Noel] She beat me.

I can't move my arm now.

-You were too powerful.
-[Prue] I'll take you to the medic.

Jeez.

[Prue] That'll keep him fit.

-[JÃ¼rgen] Sorry, sorry.
-[all chuckling]

[JÃ¼rgen] Didn't get a workout yesterday.

God, he was doing my nut in
in the practice tent.

What can I do? It's my style. [chuckling]

[Lizzie] I'm kneading mine in the mixer
'cause it's easier.

That's what's happening here.

[Noel] Using the mixer for kneading
can encourage gluten development

in an enriched and wet dough
such as milk bread.

This mixer wants to go places,
it keeps roaming around the bench.

[Noel] But overmixing
can result in a tight, crumbly loaf,

the opposite of what the judges
will expect.

Milk bread is soft, and it's got
a baby-food texture, if you like.

[Noel] Baby food is something
that JÃ¼rgen is taking literally.

When we got the brief,
my wife Sophia, my coach,

immediately thought of a baby.

A baby is round, a baby drinks
a lot of milk, a baby is sweet.

Erm, everything the sculpture should be.

And so that's what I'm going to make.

[Matt] A creche of toys
and two milk bottles

filled with chocolate
and vanilla crÃ¨me mousseline

will surround JÃ¼rgen's
playful milk-bread baby

on a polka dot play mat.

-[Prue] We're going to eat a baby?
-Yes. Yeah.

Okay.

Well, you can eat the milk bottle
and the various toys.

Oh, there will be toys around?

-You can leave the baby for Paul.
-Okay.

Paul would love to eat a baby.

[Prue] Okay, baby and toys.

I'm looking forward to seeing this baby
and eating its rattle.

-Great.
-[both laughing]

So it's going to prove
for about 90 minutes,

in order for the yeast to liven up.

It will need a lot of time
to develop the flavour

and to develop the loftiness
that is typical of the milk bread.

I'm not using the proving drawer.
It's warm in here.

Let's have some faith here.

[Matt] While George may be confident
with the prove,

his concerns lie elsewhere.

[George] What worries me the most
is the baking process.

And stacking, 'cause it's kind of
going to be a bit stacked.

[Matt]
Sitting on a cinnamon-flavoured tree

will be his children's favourite animal,

a koala bear, whose legs will be filled
with chocolate and tahini.

[Paul] Have you practised this?

-I have. The first time was horrendous.
-Right.

It ended up looking
like a sunken sea turtle,

or some sort of blob.

The bread's very soft.

When you start stacking it,
anything can happen.

It's all about the shape.

So you just got to be careful
with proving and baking.

[Matt] With multiple doughs to make,
prove and bake

time management is crucial.

[Freya] Probably one of the hardest bits

is being able to stagger
your different bits,

so they're all sort of proved
and baked by the end.

[Matt] And if things weren't already
tricky enoughâ¦

I've got a system of Post-it Notes
going on so I don't get confused.

'Cause that's
what you don't need to be doing.

â¦some of the bakers
have decided to make fillings

to complement the flavour
of their milk bread.

[JÃ¼rgen] I'm making my crÃ¨me mousseline

which is essentially crÃ¨me pat
with added butter.

I'm doing the lemons
sort of like a craqueline,

which is going to go on my roast potatoes.

[Noel] When it comes
to flavours and fillings,

Crystelle is pushing the gravy boat out.

My milk bread Showstopper,
I'm calling it "Bready for Sunday Roast."

Because for me,

roast dinner is what
brings my family together.

[Noel] Inspired by family roasts

that have continued online
during lockdown,

Crystelle is bringing
a host of flavours to the table.

I've got a lime curd piped in my potatoes.

I've got a carrot cake-inspired filling
for my carrots.

Erm, I've got
a chocolate hazelnut frangipane,

which is going on my Yorkshire pudding.

Oh, Yorkshire puddings.

[LIzzie] This is a honey glaze
for my pig banquet.

[Noel] And Lizzie has traced
the traditional roast

back to its beginnings.

Where I walk my dog, normally,
it's like an old Tudor hall.

So I'm doingâ¦
If you were a Tudor, on your table,

you get a pig and veg around them.
Like that.

[Matt] Lizzie's Tudor hog roast
will be infused with mango tea

from her local tea shop

and have added sweetness
in the form of condensed milk.

-[Paul] That'll be nice and sweet.
-The reason for the condensed milk--

I just liked it better.
Plus, I've been having it in coffee.

-Nice, lovely in coffee.
-[Lizzie] Yes!

Maggie said it's gonna kill me,
that my arteries are gonna be clogged,

but it's worth the risk.

Bakers, you are halfway through!

Okay, what am I doing?

-Eh, do you want a handshake?
-No.

-Sorry, Paul, your fingers are too doughy.
-Hey, hey, come on.

This is proved, I'm happy,
I'm happy with the size.

[Matt] If the first batches
have risen to the occasionâ¦

All right, if that stays, it's ready.

[chuckles] This is a family show, right?

â¦it's time to start shaping the dough,

which is key to achieving the distinctive
themes Paul and Prue are looking for.

[Maggie] It's proved a little faster
than I thought but not much.

So I need eight legs.

It's a tricky dough to shape,
because it's so soft and supple.

You've got to really
accentuate the shapes now,

'cause it's going to lose a lot
in the oven.

[Rochica] So this is
the top of the birdcage.

I need to make sure it keeps its shape.

It's worked three times,
so just need it to work today.

[Matt] Rochica will be hoping her cinnamon
and nutmeg-flavoured milk bread

will hold together to form a bird cage

alongside a cinnamon bird and nest of eggs
based on the birdbath in her nan's garden.

Are you a fan of birds?

-Not really. But my nan is.
-Do you like baking?

-Not right now.
-[both laughing]

-[Matt] Are you learning?
-Yeah, I am learning every day.

I always say about Paul Hollywood,

people come into this tent,

they're really learning
from the fourth or fifth best.

Yeah. [chuckling]

I had a pet pig called Susie.
It died. Didn't eat it.

Right now he's clearly a pig.
He could very much change.

I've had some disasters.

[Matt] Oh, look at the baby.

-[JÃ¼rgen] Yes.
-Have you made this at home?

I made this in the practice tent.

Was it authentic?
Did it taste of real baby?

It tasted, uh, sweet
as a real baby tastes, yes.

I knew there was something about this guy.

-I haven't eaten babies.
-No.

Let's get a few suckers on
and then I can get him in the oven.

If the suckers stay on,
the little suckers.

-Wow.
-What do you think it looks like?

Uhâ¦

-Oh, you're going to say somethingâ¦
-Paul naked.

-[both laugh]
-Chicken, of course.

165. We're going low and slow.
Like you'd cook a pig anyway, isn't it?

[Matt] Milk bread needs
a lower temperature than standard bread,

as the lactose in the milk
can cause it to brown

before it's fully baked through.

I'm baking at 170 degrees.

Sweet dough likes lower temperatures
because the sugars burn easily.

[Matt] But if you take it out too soon,

it will flatten,
losing its all-important shape.

They're going in at different times

because I've got different sizes
and I want them to bake evenly.

[Chigs] I'm going to get
the next one ready now.

But making and shaping milk bread.
Two different things.

So I'm trying to just create something
simple but trying to do it well.

[Noel] Inspired by family picnics
as a child in Leicestershire,

Chigs is forming his orange blossom
honey-flavoured milk bread

into a picnic basket
containing bread, fruits and cheeses.

-Is this what goes in the basket?
-There's some apples.

-Yeah.
-And grapes.

-Yeah.
-Some bigger grapes.

Yes.

-Swiss cheese.
-Yes.

And then in the proving oven,
I've got someâ¦ Do you mind?

-Some bread rolls, I've made.
-Oh, that's clever.

So what you've done
is you've used bread to make bread rolls.

-Yeah.
-Conceptual.

-Do you like that?
-Yeah.

[Noel] Also filling a basket
full of treats for his family

is Giuseppe.

[Giuseppe] My Showstopper is effectively
a collection of fruit and veg.

We at home use and eat
an inordinate amount of fruit and veg.

I would like to say that we do it

because we want to set
the example to the kids.

We just do it
because we genuinely like it.

[Noel] Giuseppe's fruit and veg
will be flavoured

with the zest of three oranges,
cinnamon and orange extract

and glazed with an orange liqueur
and honey syrup.

Well, someone had
a pretty good day yesterday, didn't they?

-Who was that?
-Who could that be?

Who's that? I don't know. You tell me.

Did you call your family and tell them?

-Indeed. Yes.
-Did you? What did they say?

-Well, my wife was very happy.
-Yeah.

When I told my mum she was like,
"What the hell is Bake Off?"

-Really?
-She has no idea.

I'm going to do a time call,
but I'll do it in the style of Crystelle.

I'm just going to get into character.

Bakers, you have one hour left.

I think that was pretty good.

Right, it's going in now.

[Rochica] So I've just put
the other parts of my birdcage in,

so they're going in for 15 minutes.

This is now becoming a juggling act
because there's so many elements here.

I don't want an under-baked dough,
that would be a disaster.

This is the koala going in now.

And now we wait.

Gonna give it a bit longer.

Oh, God, this is horrible.
Just worrying about him.

Just sick with worry.

-You all right?
-Yeah.

Happy? No problems?

-No problems. Yeah.
-Baby in the oven?

[laughing] This is a conversation I didn't
imagine I would be having with someone.

Coincidentally, it's a bun as well.

I think it can come out.

I'm petrified of it not being cooked,

but also, I want it to be cooked.

I think that they look fine.

Who knows? Who knows?
Just gonna pop this onto the top.

[Matt] With the breads beginning
to come out of the ovenâ¦

These are better shaped
than yesterday's breadsticks.

â¦decoration and assembly can begin.

This bit has been notorious
for going really badly.

The hardest part's
assembling the birdcage.

I've given birth. Uh, fairly happy.

[Lizzie] It's lost its definition.

With shaping bread,
it's all about the definition.

Still looks like a pig.
Once he's glazed and everything.

[Amanda laughs] Be nice with some chips.

[Noel] These are amazing.

-Hello, Neil.
-Neil or Noel?

-Noel.
-[both laugh]

I thought we were close. I'm heartbroken.

-Hello, Noel.
-[laughing]

-You know, my real name's Giuseppe.
-Is it?

[exclaims] Golly gosh.

They're not as shell-like
as I'd like them to be

but they're okay.

I don't know
if they're baked in the middle.

I've got lime curd in here

and I'm just using it
to pipe my roast potatoes.

I'm brushing the top of my crab
with agave nectar,

which is basically
a vegan version of honey.

So I've got the handle
for the basket left in the oven.

Uh, that's going to come out
in a couple of minutes.

Time check, somebody, please.

Bakers, you have ten minutes left.

[whimpers]

Oh, it's all a bit
of a shambles, isn't it, really?

That last hour just goes.

Just adding a bit of isomalt
just to secure it a bit more.

[George] Oh, used the wrong arm.
Doesn't matter.

[Lizzie] My pumpkins are a bit burnt,
but better burnt than underdone.

I wonder if the eyes are higher up.
What does a crab even look like?

They are looking okay,
unless they collapse.

Hopefully theyâ¦ They hold up.

The only thing holding
this koala together is my hands.

It looked fine a second ago.

[Freya] Stupid bread.

Just giving the kid a dummy.
Maybe it's making too much noise.

He's just lost his head. [chuckles]

It's very delicate,
but it's staying up on its own now.

Do a milk display,
why'd you have to stack it?

It's falling.

Still looking like a chicken,
which is good.

[Freya] I feel like Paul's gonna go,
"That's not attached."

Paul can like what he wants,
but he's getting what he's given.

[Rochica] Spent so long trying to fix this
that I left them in the oven too long.

Bakers, you have one minute left.

[Crystelle] Oh, God.

[Maggie] I'm really on it now.

It's a particular breed of mushroom,
this one,

that you can only find
in the Bake Off tent.

I don't know whether there's
any sweetcorn in Tudor banquets

but there is in mine.

Oh. I thought I'd lost an arm.

I would never plate a roast dinner
up like this at home.

Oh, right,
I need to put them on the board.

[JÃ¼rgen] Some finishing touches.

[Lizzie] Don't like the way
he's gone all crinkly.

[Giuseppe] Doesn't want to fit anywhere.

Oh, that's hilarious. [laughs]

Oh, my God! Just stay.

Bakers, your time is up.

-All right.
-Please step away from your bakes.

-[sighs heavily]
-[Chigs] Sick, happy, done.

Can I eat this?

Comfort eating. [laughing]

[Giuseppe] We are a good bunch, aren't we?
Look at that octopus.

Everything is so stunning.

[Noel] It's judgment time
for the baker's Showstoppers.

[in Australian accent] Mate,
would you like to bring your koala up?

[all laughing]

-I think he's adorable.
-[Paul] It's simple, but it works.

[Prue] Lovely.

The bread's a bit heavy.

The thing is, when you do
stand-up milk bread sculptures,

the dough is so soft, it will collapse.

-Yeah.
-[Paul] It works on a koala.

'Cause it's quite charming.

But it's concertinaed up
because it can't carry the weight.

But I think the design is clever enough,
and your base oneâ¦

This is nice. It's just sweet enough.

-[Prue] Well done, George.
-Thank you very much.

You've caught a few of them in the oven.

-Yeah.
-But I quite like that.

-Looks like it's been on a barbecue.
-[both laughing]

But the overall design
I think is very clever.

The pig was probably up here,
and it's dropped a bit.

So basically you've got mango tea.

Yeah. I did have a pet pig,
so, it's called, er, Susie.

What happened to Susie?

She slipped on ice,
we had to get her put down.

[all chuckling]

Slipped on ice?

-Yeah.
-Don't take pigs ice-skating.

She was living in the garden,
the ground got icy.

I like the texture. And it is light.

You can get that tea, can't you?

-Not sure whether I like it, but, ermâ¦
-Quite perfumed.

But I can identify it,
that's the key thing.

-Thank you, Lizzie.
-Ta.

It's beautifully done.

[Paul] It's not bad.
It looks quite well-proved.

You can see how round it is.

[Prue] I think that's really well made.

But I don't get
a lot of orange blossom flavour.

You get a hint of something
slightly aromatic at the back.

It's light, it's fluffy.

The textures and colours
are pretty consistent.

-It's a nice bread, that.
-[Prue] Very nice.

Good design.
Simple but highly effective as well.

-Thank you.
-[Prue] Well done, Chigs.

It's quite abstract. Looks quite rustic,
and then this looks quite neat.

Yes.

Is that four and a half hours'
worth of work?

Well, it was for me.

[all laughing]

Good answer.

[continues laughing]

It's under-proved and it's got no flavour.

I'm hard-pushed
to find the seaweed in that.

See, there's simply not enough in it.

The sweetness is there,
but it's very cake-like.

Could be a bit lighter.

But I honestly think
if you put a bit of salt in it,

you'd have the flavour,
because I can get the seaweed.

But there's no doubt
that salt would enhance it.

[Maggie]
Well, that's rather disappointing.

-But never mind.
-[Paul] Yeah, it is.

-Thank you, Maggie.
-Thank you.

[Noel] Well done.

The way you've incorporated
different flavours

in different breads is very clever.

The babyâ¦

[Paul and Prue chuckle]

â¦is very basic,
but it does work, it's effective.

Colour looks great on the bread as well.
You glazed this?

I glazed it with egg wash. Egg wash.

Lovely flavour.

-[Prue] Very good flavour.
-The sweetness level's just right.

But for me, it is slightly under-proved,

and therefore
you haven't got that structure.

So, nearly there.

-[Paul] Thank you, JÃ¼rgen.
-Thank you.

It's very clever.
And you've created a theme.

The chicken could have been a bit higher.

-Spatchcock.
-Uh, yeah.

[Prue] It's definitely
a spatchcock or a turtle.

I think your craqueline
could've been a bit darker.

-[Crystelle] Okay.
-[Paul] A bit longer in the oven

would've created more of a darkness to it.

The flavours are great, though.
The citrus kick is fantastic.

The top is beautiful.
The texture is lovely. It's light.

It's got a nice sweetness to it,
which is just right.

-It's really a nice slice of bread.
-Thank you very much.

I think the design is incredible.
You've done an amazing job.

It's actually quite simple,
but you've executed it beautifully.

Paul's never had fruit or veg before.

He only eats bread.
So can you tell us what each one is?

So you've got a courgette--

-He is as well.
-[all laughing]

Apples and mushrooms, yeah.

The texture in there,
it's light, it bounces back.

And the flavour's in there as well.

It's difficult to get orange
to come through in bread,

but you get the zest,
which is a much purer form of orange.

I think you've done
something that's, erm, very clever.

It's absolutely delicious.
And I think the texture's lovely.

-Well done, Giuseppe.
-Thank you.

I think you've done a really good job.

You've lost a lot of definition,
but you've utilized that to your strengths

to make the octopus the way it does.

It's very clever and effective.

I think it's delightful.

You can see how tender the loaf is.

I love that. I love the flavour.

The sweetness is just the right side
of sweetness, and the texture is spot-on.

But it's not bouncy.

You've ended up
with a massive air pocket in there.

But I think it's very good,
very brioche-like.

-It's light, it's well-baked.
-I think you've done a terrific job.

-Well done.
-Thank you so much.

There's something wrong
with the proportions.

That little bird, even if it was upright,

couldn't have laid those eggs
in a million years.

It's over-proved.
You've lost it 'cause it's going flat.

It's a bit tight.
It's under-proved as well.

This is going to prove
at a slightly different level to this.

-[Rochica] Oh, okay.
-[Paul] Because it's smaller pieces.

The cinnamon level's right.
Sweetness level's right as well.

Just that the dough's too dense.

And when you say
that's four and a half hours' work,

I wouldn't believe you.

Erm, that does taste absolutely delicious.
But the texture's not right.

-[Paul] Thank you, Rochica.
-Thank you.

[Prue] I think it's really very amusing.

And I must say that the crab shell
is so realistic.

-It's beautifully done.
-I like it, it's very neat.

Let's have a look.

Is the beach demerara sugar
or soft brown sugar?

Yeah, it's soft brown sugar.

Nice milk bread.
The structure's light, holds its shape.

And the sweetness levels
are just right as well.

-It's not overly sweet.
-It's nicely baked.

Tastes good, and I love the look of it.
I think it's just hilarious.

Aw, thank you so much. [chuckles]

[Freya] I'm so pleased.

I wasn't sure what to expect
coming into this week,

with me not really enjoying bread.

So I'm really thrilled about it. Yeah.

[Maggie] I'm disappointed
that I didn't do better in the bread,

'cause I make bread all the time.

And this is maybe
the last time you see me.

[Rochica] It's definitely been
my worst week.

I would like another chance,
but I don't know if I'm going to get one.

[sighs]

[Matt] So where are we at?

Milk bread's quite difficult
to do properly.

I think most of them
did a pretty good job.

Simplicity was the way forward.
And I think Giuseppe got that.

What Giuseppe has done is clever.

-[Noel] What about Freya?
-[Paul] I would say Freya was up there.

She has done well.

There's a few people
who are sort of middle ground,

and I thought JÃ¼rgen saved himself.

-George is--
-Lizzie is doing well.

Lizzie really excelled, I think.

What about Maggie?

-[Paul] Maggie struggled.
-[Prue] I think she's in trouble.

I didn't get the flavours in that.

I thought the structure
wasn't particularly good.

I think it was a little bit too simple.

I think the two people,
I think Maggie and I also think Rochica.

The trouble with Rochica's
is that the whole thing didn't work

because there wasn't
a loaf of bread there,

and we're trying to judge bread.

But I really like them all now.
I don't want anybody to go home.

This is quite a hard point to leave,

because they're just
getting to know each other nowâ¦

-Settled--
-Settling into the life

of the prison camp where we film.

[all chuckling]

To be fair, a lot of them
have tried to escape already.

Well done, bakers. Big week, bread week.

Especially in front
of the breadfather, Paul.

It's a tough one,
but you all did really well.

I've got the great job this week
of announcing who is Star Baker.

The person who's Star Baker this week isâ¦

-Giuseppe.
-[all applauding]

Yeah! Bravo!

Now I have the less fun job of telling you
who's going to be going home,

and it gets harder and harder each week

because we're becoming friends
and we're bonding.

And we don't want to lose anyone.

But I'm afraid
we are going to be losing somebody,

and that person isâ¦

Rochica.

[Freya] It's okay.

[Rochica] It's come to end,
but I have really, really enjoyed it.

And not everybody gets to bake
in the Bake Off tent.

So I'm proud of where I've got to.

And I'm just going to keep baking.

Just don't do anything to,
like, time. [laughs]

-We're gonna miss you.
-I'll miss you too.

-Just getting to know you.
-I know, right?

[Maggie] Your family
will be so happy to see you.

[laughing] I think
I was very close to the edge.

The cliff was crumbling rather badly,
but I seem to have scraped through again.

-Well done, Maggie.
-I don't know how I keep doing it.

-Squeak through.
-Squeak through.

Next week,
I've got to be spectacular. [snorts]

[JÃ¼rgen] Can't win them all.
Can't win all the Star Bakers.

It feels very good to be
at the end of Bread Week and still in.

-[Prue] So deserved, really.
-Thank you.

Star Baker, can you believe that?

Especially for Bread Week.

I better savour it 'cause
it ain't gonna happen again. [laughs]

The bakers attempt to perfect traditional German biscuits in the Signature, followed by a Technical torte fit for a prince. Finally, they must rise to the challenge by creating a tiered cake using yeast.

âª Welcome to the Baking Show âª

âª Baking Show, Baking Show âª

âª This week it is German week
German week, German week âª

âª Thank you for explaining me
Explaining me, explaining me âª

âª We are baking in the tent
In the tent, in the tent âª

âª Welcome to the Baking Showâ¦ âª

[music dies down]

It seems we has been unplugged

âª Been unplugged, been unplugged âª

[both] Welcome to
The Great British German Baking show.



Ja!

[Matt in normal accent] Nowâ¦

I can hear the Bake-Off
"rushing" music in my head.

â¦it's German week.

It's time to get fingers dirty. [chuckles]

[Matt] A Bavarian biscuit Signatureâ¦

-[George] Come on!
-[Matt] An uber tricky Technicalâ¦

-They're all going.
-This is getting stressful.

[Matt] And a yeast-leavened Showstopper

will determine
who will rise to the occasionâ¦

That's beautiful.
I've never had anything like that before.

-[Matt] And who will getâ¦
-Oh, no!

[Matt] Das Boot.

Come on! You got this.



-I hope so.
-Not as much as JÃ¼rgen, but you got it!

[chuckles]

[theme music playing]

[indistinct chatter]

I'm so excited to be halfway through.
I'm feeling good, yeah!

The weather's really nice.
I'm feeling positive.

For now, anyway.

German week this week.

What is German week? I've got no idea.
I've never baked German stuff.

JÃ¼rgen's week. Just another
one of JÃ¼rgen's weeks. [chuckles]

We're just here for the ride. [chuckles]

How do you say "good luck" in German?

-Viel GlÃ¼ck.
-Viel GlÃ¼ck.

But on a show like this you would say,

Hals- und Beinbruch, which means
"break a leg and break your neck."

-Oh, good God!
-That's brutal. [chuckling]

[all laughing]

There's certainly a bit of pressure
being here in German week as a German.

You might argue JÃ¼rgen is in a favourable
position because of his heritage,

but it's a competition
at the end of the day,

so I'll give it my best shot.

German week,
I don't usually bake German stuff

but we'll see how it goes.

If it goes like my GCSE in German
then I'm out of here.

Good morning, bakers!
Welcome back to the tent.

Now, this week is a first.

It is German week.

And we can reveal
the Star Baker is JÃ¼rgen!

[Crystelle laughing]

It is German week,
and it's your Signature Challenge

and the judges would love you to make
two batches of 12 German biscuits.

Your two batches
should be exquisitely finished

and dipped, coated or decorated.

You have two hours, 15 minutes.

-On your marks!
-[sing-song] Get set!

Backen.

[Chigs] All right, let's go.

Doing 24 biscuits in just over two hours
is quite difficult.

I don't know what I'm doing.

I'm just baking a biscuit
I think is relatively German.

[chuckles] But we'll see.

One of the most important things
about German biscuits

is that they're
usually produced for Christmas.

So people take a lot of trouble
about the decoration,

so they are intricately iced.

What we want
are two different types of biscuit,

one with butter, shortbread type biscuits
which are very crumbly.

And one with ground almonds
that creates a macaron-style biscuit

which is crispy on the outside
and slightly chewy on the inside.

I wouldn't like them to step
too far away from the original.

They might change the flavour,
they might change the icing,

but they should still be recognisable
as German biscuits.

I think a lot of bakers are going to be
watching JÃ¼rgen to see what he does.

But I think they need
to concentrate on their own game.

[birds chirping]

It's time to get fingers dirty. [chuckles]

[Noel] For their first batch,

most of the bakers have chosen
a shortbread-style biscuit.

Shortbread should be quite crumbly.

Erm, I think the key
is not to overwork it.

If you overwork the dough, the biscuit
becomes really tough and not short.

[Noel] And whilst
the technique may be familiar,

the language is not.

Springurle? Springuler?

Hausâ¦ freudâ¦ dunâ¦ Hausfreudun?
And that means house of friends?

I'm making glu-vine-plakton.

GlÃ¼hweinplÃ¤tzchen.

-Glu-vine-platchin?
-GlÃ¼hweinplÃ¤tzchen.

-Plat-zchen.
-Very good.

There is a bonus to him being here.

Apart from the fact
he's going to get Star Baker.

Star Baker already
before starting, that's harsh, yes.

[chuckles] Got two days to get through.

[Matt] For his shortbread batch,

JÃ¼rgen is recreating
his brother's favourite almond horns.

But giving them a caffeinated
kick with espresso powder.

He'll decorate both sets
of biscuits with white and dark chocolate

in his bid to claim
German week's Star Baker crown.

This is weird for you, isn't it?
'Cause you have to do well this week.

[chuckles] Everyone's expecting you
to do really well.

I have to do well because I like
this bunch of people and want to stay.

And also you want to be able
to go home again?

No one watches
the show in Germany, do they?

-Er, they have their own version--
-They have a German version of me?

Er, no, they have one host.

[whispers] One host.

-So efficient!
-Very efficient.

I've been here longer
than Matt, remember that.

-Yeah.
-If they cut it down to one hostâ¦

-Just saying.
-[both chuckle]

[Matt] JÃ¼rgen may have
the home advantage this week,

but one bakerâ¦

-Good morning.
-Good morning.

â¦is hoping to spice up
his German biscuits the Italian way.

I will be flavouring the dough with pisto,
which is a--

-[Matt] Gravy?
-[laughs]

With gravy?
That's going to make it savoury.

-Pisto.
-Oh, pisto.

[Noel] Giuseppe's pisto spice mix

contains cinnamon, aniseed,
black pepper and cloves.

He's hoping it will compliment
the strawberry jam of his Linzer Augen,

which he'll decorate
with candied orange stars.

You would think biscuits
are relatively easy,

but we got two batches to make,
they have to be highly decorated,

so time, as usual,
is not working in our favour.

[Noel] Paul and Prue
will also be expecting consistency

across both batches.

I'm just weighing them out
so they're sort of somewhat the same.

To be honest, I am just winging this.

[Lizzie] It's quite a sticky dough,

so I just find it easier
to use a cheesecake thing.

It's all weighed out
and then just flatten it.

-Hello!
-[Matt] Hello.

Tell us all about your German biscuits.

Erm, my first ones areâ¦

Is it worth me
pronouncing these, honestly?

-I think the Liverpool accent will agree.
-Lends itself.

[Matt] Helps 'cause you got thatâ¦
[makes guttural sound] â¦sound.

It's called Spitzbuben.

[all chuckling]

And that means cheeky boys, apparently.

[Matt] Said to resemble
the face of a mischievous child,

Lizzie's cheeky boys
will be made even cheekier

with the addition of mixed spice
and an apple and cardamom jam.

[Lizzie] I don't know whether
to pipe on eyelashes and lips.

Or if that's going to be too wacky.

They don't seem
to like my colourful wackiness. [laughs]

[exhales] It's getting hot in here.

[Noel] Working with a butter-rich
shortbread dough in a hot tentâ¦

The fact that I'm shaking doesn't help.

â¦means the bakers will need
extra resting time before baking.

[gasping]

[Amanda] If you put it in the oven
at room temperature,

it will just spread out,

so if you put it in the freezer,
get it really cold, it'll hold its shape.

[Noel] But Crystelle
has a different strategy

for ensuring her biscuits
will retain their shape in the oven.

[Crystelle] So these are brown butter
shortbread, that'll chill for 15 minutes

and then I'm gonna bake them
like this and cut out rounds,

I find it's the best way
to get them uniform.

How do you ensure
that it's all equal in there?

In height. You're gonna
get a thick biscuit and a thin biscuit.

Erm, I'm using a little cake scraper
just to kind of scrape that across.

And I'll say a little prayer
and hope they're all the same height.

[Matt] Crystelle is aiming for
12 perfectly round shortbreads

which she's flavouring
with cardamom and pistachio

and decorating with spun white chocolate.

Small state of panic now,
because there isn't a lot of time

and these should be
in the freezer already.

[Matt] And Crystelle isn't the only one
racing to rest their biscuits.

[George] I've got to get my skates on.

[Matt] George's biscuits have
an intricate embossed design,

which could lose definition in the oven
if not chilled for long enough.

Really, you need to let them
rest for like ages, like 24 hours.

I don't have that time.

[Matt] Not only do George's
embossed aniseed biscuits

require a lot of resting time, once baked,
they're traditionally left to mature

to achieve their characteristic
honeycomb texture.

So it might be a bit softer
than it would be in two days' time.

Maybe not the best biscuit choice
in the tent, but I like 'em.

-We'll see. Thanks.
-[George] All right.

Thanks, guys!

-You can speak German?
-Yeah!

-Why don't you do the time call--
-Okay, all right, I will. Here we go!

[in German accent]
Bakers, you're halfway through!

-And that's German, is it?
-[normally] Yeah.

[Noel] The first set of biscuits
might be restingâ¦

Right. Next.

â¦but there's no respite for the bakers.

When one biscuit dough's chilling,
you move onto your other biscuit dough,

and while that's baking,
you do something else, and it's nonstop.

Need to keep moving.

[Matt] For their second batch, the bakers
have all chosen almond-based biscuits.

[JÃ¼rgen] This is actually
very simple to make

because it's just
a paste of almond, sugar and egg white.

It's grim, innit? It's sticky dough.

[Chigs] This one's pure marzipan.
They're called almond horns.

I'm going to infuse this with orange.

I'm always told
they can't taste my flavours.

I'm gonna ramp it up a little bit more.

[Matt] With the zest of three oranges,

Chigs is hoping to pack a punch
with his Marzipan horns,

which he'll decorate with spun chocolate
and flaked almonds.

So I've never ever
tried these biscuits before.

It's supposed to be crunchy outside
with a very chewy interior.

I want to make sure
you can taste the orange.

With the amount of zest you put in there,
no doubt we will.

[laughs]

[Matt] Also giving her
almond biscuits a fruity twist is Freya.

I've added in some glace cherries.
A bit like a cherry Bakewell.

So it's kind of like a British version.

[Matt] Inspired by
the Christmas classic cinnamon stars,

Freya's cherry-laden version

will be topped with a thin layer
of intricately decorated vegan meringue.

These are going in for 15 minutes.

[Chigs] Right. Let's go!

[Matt] With such a short bake timeâ¦

I'm putting 'em on for ten minutes.
To start with. That should be okay.

â¦the bakers have a small window

to prepare any jams
or filling for their biscuits.

What are you doing now?

I'm going to measure out some jam
and mix it with the marzipan.

-That sounds like baking to me.
-Yeah.

-That sounds like German baking.
-Proper German baking.

-[Noel] Come on.
-Yeah.

You've got this.
Not as much as JÃ¼rgen, but you got it!

[Amanda] That's going to be
the mulled wine jam.

Mulled wine is my favourite drink
when I go skiing.

And that sounds like I'm really good,
but I'm the worst skier on the planet.

So I normally drown my sorrows
with a couple of glasses of GlÃ¼hwein.

[Noel] Amanda's aprÃ¨s ski-inspired jam
will be bursting with Christmas flavours

and will sandwich
her iced vanilla shortbread hearts.

That jam sounds delicious.

It is delicious.
If nothing else, you'll like the jam.

No, we're planning
on liking everything, Amanda.

[all chuckle]

-[Paul] Thank you.
-I'll do my best.

Hopefully, they'll come out okay.

In fact, I hope they come out perfect.

-[Noel] But every minute in the ovenâ¦
-[George] Come on.

Gonna give 'em another two minutes.

â¦means less baking and cooling time
for their second batch of biscuits.

This is getting stressful now.

Are you excited for German week?

Nope. Why would you
be excited for German week?

I'd be excited for German week
because I was raised by a German family.

-Was you?
-[Noel] Yeah.

-In a forest in Munich.
-In a forest?

I say family. It was a family of wolves.

[both laugh]

[Amanda] I'm taking them out.

[Matt] As the first batch of biscuitsâ¦

-My coffee horns are ready.
-Perfect.

[Freya] I feel like these are definitely
not gonna come off of the paper. [sighs]

â¦make way for the secondâ¦

-[George] Two, four, six eight.
-Who do we appreciate?

German biscuits.

These go in.

Multitasking to the max.

â¦the bakers must juggle
preparing their decorative elementsâ¦

[Giuseppe] I'm creating some little
decorations for the Linzer Augen.

[JÃ¼rgen] I'm going to
temper some white chocolate.

[gasps dramatically] In this weather.

-â¦with keeping a watchful eyeâ¦
-One more minute.

â¦on the biscuits still in the oven.

[Amanda] They're spreading out,
but what can you do?

It's fine.

[in German accent]
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left!

-[normally] That is not actual German.
-It is. I've seen 'Allo 'Allo!

I'm just gonna highlight
some of the design.

They look German, ja?

[Lizzie] I'm gonna pipe
some eyelashes onto these,

and some lips.

Like cheeky girls you can be.

[JÃ¼rgen] I believe the temper is okay.

[Crystelle] Those all look
like the same height.

I think these are ready.

[JÃ¼rgen] Coming out.

Nice uniformly baked.

They look okay. Some of them have cracked.

[Freya] They look all right.
I might peel the burned raisins off

'cause Paul's not gonna love that.

[Amanda] Gotta get those decorations on.

Now it's time to put them together.

[George] Glue. Glue together, baby.

-[Lizzie] This is just my jam.
-It's nice and thick.

Would dribble out of the biscuits
if it wasn't.

[Amanda] Oh, dammit.
I need to get a move on.

[Freya] I'll just put the icing
on the burned bits, that's fine.

How long have we got now?

Bakers, you have one minute left.

Oh, God.

[exhales]

[Amanda] Ugh! Gosh.

I can hear the Bake-Off
"rushing" music in my head.

[JÃ¼rgen] Wonderful.

[Lizzie] They're cheeky and they've
just been found out doing something.

[Giuseppe] It is Christmas. It's snowing.

[JÃ¼rgen] Messy. Messy, messy.

Bakers, your time is up.

[exhales]

[JÃ¼rgen] Chocolate isn't setting.
But it was not a surprise in this heat.

[George] Don't worry about that.

[Amanda] Oh, I've got one missing.

[Noel] The bakers' two batches
of German biscuits

now face the judgment of Paul and Prue.

[Prue] They all look lovely.

[Paul] Let's start with
the orange and strawberry, shall we?

[Prue] That is beautifully done.
Really beautiful.

[Paul] The orange
in the shortbread is delicious.

Blends beautifully with the strawberry.

And the spice that you've got in there,
it's just perfect. Right.

Coffee and pecan, eh?

They're going to be lovely, I'm sure.

Unusual and delicious.

And the pecan, that nuttiness
that it brings to the coffee is perfect.

-Really lovely.
-Thank you.

Thank you.

[Paul] They look very nice.

[Prue] Let's see if they taste
half as good as they look.

[Crystelle] I have done
brown butter shortbread

with pistachios and cardamom.

I love the flavour.
It's quite unusual, too.

The second biscuits
are hazelnuts and orange zest

with a chocolate hazelnut filling.

So delicate, the orange. It's just right.

The amount of chocolate is perfect.
You've got that chew in the middle.

They're really interesting.
Beautifully made.

-Think they're a triumph. Well done.
-Thank you. [sighs in relief]

[Chigs] So that's a vanilla shortbread

with raspberry jam and a disk of marzipan.

And the bottom ones are purely marzipan
with some orange.

[Paul] Your textures are beautiful.

-The marzipan you get, but can't taste.
-[Chigs] Okay.

[Prue] This one is nice and chewy
in the middle, crisp on the outside.

-Very good orange.
-[Paul] Your flavours are good,

but it's a shame
we didn't get marzipan coming through.

-But good job.
-Thank you.

[Prue] I just love your cheeky girls.

I mean, their little astonished mouths

and eyelashes going out the side
is just beautiful.

[Paul] It needed
slightly longer in the oven,

because it looks like raw paste.

The flavour with the cinnamon,
with the apple, is delicious.

The jam is spectacular.

I like the colour of these,
but they're all over the place.

I think they're a bit too big.

For me, there's too much chocolate.

If you manage to avoid the chocolate,
the almond flavour is delicious.

[Paul] If you'd made them half-size,
bake them properly,

you'd have been getting a handshake.

So if I'd just done it
completely different.

-[Paul] Yeah.
-[all laughing]

I think the mulled wine biscuits are nice,
all 11 of them.

The orange and chocolate one,
it's lost its definition.

The biscuit tastes beautiful.
It's such a delicate, buttery biscuit.

-Let's have a look at these.
-[Noel] These are called hearts, Paul.

-Most normal people have them.
-[Prue chuckles]

-Never seen one before.
-[Noel chuckles]

-This is an astonishingly good biscuit.
-[Amanda] Thank you.

Biscuit is very short and buttery
and delicious.

The jam is sensational.

I mean, it really is worth every calorie.

-Thank you so much.
-[Paul] Thank you very much.

[Prue] I think that's lovely.

What's so good is that the kirsch
and the cherry acidity

makes the whole thing lighter.

And these ones should be quite crisp.
Is that right?

[George] They should be
crispy on the outside.

As they age,
they get crispy on the inside too.

-I mean, it's tough.
-[George] Yeah.

It's so tough,
it's offering me out for a fight.

But I love the flavours of both.
You've done really well.

I question whether that was
the right choice to use on this challenge.

I completely agree.

-[Prue chuckles]
-[Paul] But well done.

-Thank you.
-Thanks.

It's not supposed to be like that.
The bottom of the biscuits stuck.

Well, they're certainly chewy, Freya.
And they're delicious.

[Paul] Let's try this Christmas pud,
shall we?

I love the flavours.
But it is certainly overbaked.

-Yeah, yeah.
-[Prue] It is overbaked.

Fruit has got a bit burnt.

But the flavour's lovely.
Especially the lemon.

I think they look lovely.

You've got some uniformity here,
which I like to see.

I think they do look very nice.

I can't add anything to that.
I think they look absolutely perfect.

-Let's try the star one first.
-[JÃ¼rgen] Yep.

-I flavoured them with Earl Grey tea.
-[Prue] Tea?

-It really comes through nice and strong.
-[Paul] Mmm. Yeah.

Really like it. Right.

[Prue] The horns. Shall we do the horns?

The coffeeâ¦
You can smell the coffee, can't you?

That is the crumbliest,
buttery-est biscuit

I think I've ever eaten,
it is just perfect.

Thank you.

That's delicious.
I think you've done well there, JÃ¼rgen.

[contestants applauding]

[JÃ¼rgen] Thank you.

-[Paul] Good job.
-Wow. [laughs]

It was pretty overwhelming,
judging and a handshake.

I nearly started to cry right there.

Underbaked. I don't know.

Should I really trust Paul?

Because I done them
for 15 minutes yesterday

and JÃ¼rgen said they were overbaked.

So I done them for 12 minutes today,
and Paul's saying they're underbaked.

I think JÃ¼rgen's right. Just saying.

[Matt] While the bakers
could practise their Signature bakes,

they have no idea
what they'll be asked to make

in today's Teutonic Technical Challenge.

Hello, bakers. Welcome back to the tent.

It's time for your Technical Challenge,

which today has been set for you
by the lovely Prue.

Any words of wisdom?

Don't panic and try to be methodical.

As ever, the technical challenge
will be judged blind,

so we're gonna have to ask these two
to sling their hooks. Off you pop.

[in cockney accent]
Yeah, go and put your feet up.

Don't worry about us.

Oh, you must be exhausted
coming here for 30 seconds,

eating a load of biscuits.
I don't know how you do it.

[Noel laughs]

Now, for your Technical Challenge,

Prue would love you
to make Prinzregententorte.

Which is basically Prince Regent cake.

[normally] Your cake should be comprised
of eight thin layers

of light German genoises.

Sandwiched with a smooth chocolate cream

and coated with a shiny chocolate ganache.

Your torte should be regally decorated

with rosettes
and tempered chocolate crowns.

[Noel] Very regal.
Have you met anyone from the royal family?

-Yeah. Ralf Little.
-[all laugh]

You have two hours, 45 minutes.

-On your marks.
-Get set.

Bake.

I ain't got a Scooby Doo.
I've never heard of this cake before.

I'm making something
that I can't even pronounce. [chuckles]

Prinz-regen-ten-torte.

[mumbles]

Ask JÃ¼rgen.

Prinzregententorte.

So, Prue. Prinzregententorte.

Basically, it's eight layers of genoises

sandwiched together
with a chocolate custard,

covered with really smooth, shiny ganache.

Well, I think it looks great.
It's highly effective.

And I think the temperatureâ¦
I think today being quite warm

will only be really affecting
the tempered chocolate.

Should be all right as long
as they chill things down in stages.

[Prue] They ought to be able to get it
perfectly straight on the sides

because they're putting it into a tin
to layer it up.

-[Paul] Let's have a look inside.
-[Prue] Yeah. Let's have a look.

I always love these layered cakes 'cause
they're so exciting when you see inside.

[Paul] The layers
look beautiful and stark,

and you can see the chocolate custard
in there all the way through.

[Prue] And it's the right proportion
of custard to cake, isn't it?

-They're about equal.
-[Paul] Let's see how it tastes.

It's delicious. Almost melts on the mouth.

But then you get that
light chocolate come from the inside

and that little bit
of dark chocolate ganache on the outside.

I think it's a great cake
to make on German week.

And I can't wait to see
how JÃ¼rgen deals with this.

[Matt] Hello, JÃ¼rgen!

So I'm assuming that you're
the only person to have made this before.

I haven't made one, I haven't eaten one.

-I can loosely remember how it looks like.
-Oh, you haven't even eaten one?

That's a waste of being German.

[JÃ¼rgen] Yeah, it's terrible.

[Noel] The first step in Prue's recipe
is to make the genoise sponge batter.

We have to make a meringue first, it says.

[Freya] I don't want the egg whites
to be like overly whipped.

I'm thinking sort of, like,
soft, stiff peaks.

I'm folding the meringue
into the egg yolk mixture.

You got to be gentle when folding,

because if you knock all the air out,
sponge is not gonna rise when you bake it.

I sound like I know
what I'm talking about, don't I?

"Spoon the batter into circles
on prepared baking sheets."

[Matt] If the bakers are to achieve

the consistent thin layers
of sponge that Prue is expectingâ¦

[groaning] Don't do that, Freya.

â¦then the batter must
be portioned out with precision.

[Giuseppe] Want to have all
the eight sheets in front of me.

Give it a bit of consistency so
the layers are all the same height.

I want it to be not thicker
than five millimetres.

'Cause if there's eightâ¦ Gonna be
about a centimetre thick each?

Probably shouldn't have been
wasting precious mixture

to glue my things down.

Butâ¦ I think it'll be all right.

Batch-bake until you have eight sponges.

There were three shelves in the oven.
So we can bake three layers at a time.

Up here for thinking,
down there for dancing.

[George] Great!

Go! Where's the timer? Quick!

There's no timing in there or anything.
I'm gonna go in for 10 to 15 minutes.

Seven minutes
and I'll swap the top and bottom

and another three minutes after that.

[Crystelle] I'm gonna bake one
to gauge the time.

I don't know if that's right,
but I'm going with it.

There's a look of Frank Zappa about you.

Yeah, Frank Zappa/Einstein?

I can see the sort of
Einstein thing, definitely.

-Fair enough.
-Yeah!

-[Matt] Yeah, there you go!
-[laughing]

-You've been a bit of an Einstein here.
-Have I?

That was a beautiful segue, come on!

-I hope you're applauding at home.
-[chuckles]

[Noel] With such thin layers
of delicate genoise spongeâ¦

Er, no, not yet.

â¦a perfect bake
demands absolute precision.

[Freya] I'm just popping a skewer in
to see if it comes out clean.

[Matt] Underbake even slightly,

and the sponges won't hold
their shape when assembled.

Let's take out this bad boy
and see how he's doing.

He kinda looks like a pancake.

[Matt] But overbake
and they'll be dry and brittle.

Give it one more minute.

I think I'm ready to take these out.

Let's take that one out.

[Amanda] My first three are
coming out now. It's a little bit rubbery.

It might be okay.

[Noel] With two more
batches to bake and coolâ¦

Second batch. In.

â¦the genoise production line
continues in earnest.

Oh! Golly gosh!
That's not what we want to see, is it?

Three sponges have come out
and three sponges have gone in.

Ermâ¦ Two more to spread out.

[George] I'm a little bit short on batter.

I'm still hopefully gonna
have enough to make do.

Maybe someone on the radio can tell me
how long the bakers have got left.

[radio static crackling]

[Matt over radio] Radio 1, Ed Sheeran,
"The Shape of You," and coming up next--

-Hang on.
-[radio static crackling]

[Matt over radio] And the bakers
are halfway through the task

and we wish them all the very best.

-Let's see what else in on.
-[radio static crackling]

[Matt in woman's voice] I was watching
that baking show the other day.

-Noel Fielding is an absolute--
-That's enough of that.

[Crystelle] I'll take
my last two sponges out.

Sponges done.

Look at that! It's so thin it could almost
pass for a poppadum.

-There's a bit of a variation here.
-Oh!

I take it back.

[George] I used more mix initially
and then I ran out.

-That's a happy accident, then.
-Yeah.

Now I need to make
the chocolate cream filling.

"For the chocolate cream,
make a chocolate custard."

Ay! Lots of detail in there.

I can pretty much make a custard, sort of.

[JÃ¼rgen] Same thing as vanilla custard,
just add a bit of cocoa.

[Crystelle] It's a bit dark but it's fine.
It's thick.

That's done.

Bakers, you have one hour remaining.
One hour!

These are relatively cool now.

Think we're going
to sort of start assembling, maybe.

[Matt] The cooler their sponges,
the more chance they'll hold when stacked.

[Crystelle] I thought my layers
would have cooled by now.

[Matt] But the longer the bakers wait,

the less time they'll have to achieve
a flawless decorative finish.

I started a bit slower to make sure one
was baked well before I did the rest.

I'm just going to hope for the best.
I don't think I've got time.

So, have I made these small enough?

I'm picking a better cooked one
for the bottom so it doesn't stick.

Sponge, cream, sponge, cream.

[Amanda] It should be a silky,
smooth filling.

It's not anywhere near it.

[sighs in exasperation]

It's hard to spread this flat

because there is a dome forming,
which isn't ideal.

Sponge, cream, sponge, cream.

Keep it equal all the way.

This is the last layer now.

And chill.

[Chigs] I'm gonna put it in
as long as I can.

We're now onto the decoration
which is the scariest part for me.

"Part 12: Chocolate crown shapes."

[Crystelle] It's the little crosses
that are so hard to pipe.

Giuseppe, how wide
is your stance right now?

-That's what giraffes do, isn't it?
-[Giuseppe chuckling]

When they bake.

Right. Ganache, ganache, ganache.

Does it just say
to make the ganache? Of course.

I know you're not supposed to, but do you
ever cast your eyes around the tent?

Yeah. I do like to
because sometimes Chigs is very irrational

and starts jumping around like a maniac.

Crystelle starts to talk to herself.

Wait, am I doing this right?

There's no point looking
over at JÃ¼rgen becauseâ¦

He's just cool as a cucumber.

-An average day for him, isn't it?
-Yeah.

[JÃ¼rgen] That looks like ganache.

[Chigs] That is a good ganache.

Bakers, you have 15 minutes left!

It's turning out.

[Lizzie] Oh, God!

It's just getting stressful. I'm sweating.

[Crystelle] Oh, why is it so wonky?

[JÃ¼rgen] The ganache
will cover the whole cake.

It's like pouring a mirror glaze.

I might do the edges first.

[Chigs] It's not bad at all.

[JÃ¼rgen] It's just a bit bubbly,
not perfect.

[George] Oh, this is so messy.
My wife would kill me if I was at home.

Bakers, you only have five minutes left.

"Using the remaining chocolate cream,
pipe 12 rosettes."

I overwhipped it.
I can't pipe that on there.

How many are we at? 12!

[Lizzie] Cream.

I'm just whipping out some plain cream
so I've got something to put on top.

[Crystelle] I'm gonna have to do thisâ¦
No! [chuckles]

What the hell? How long do I have? Oh, no!

Bakers, you have one minute left.

-[yelling quietly]
-[exhales]

Oh, my God! They're all going.

[Amanda] At least I've got something
to put the crowns into.

The chocolate is melting
at the speed of light.

[groans]

The crowns have melted.

[Crystelle, sing-song] The chocolate
is melting in my hand.

Well, I've done what I can.

Bakers, your time is up.

Very naughty of Prue, that was.

Please place your Prince Regent cake

behind your photograph
on the gingham table.

Why have we all put different cream
on top of our cakes?

It's supposed to be white cream.
You've all done it wrong.

[Matt] Prue and Paul are looking
for majestic prinzregententorte

with even layers of German genoise
and chocolate cream,

shiny ganache and perfectly piped rosettes
and chocolate crowns.

Okay. Shall we start over here?

[Prue] Rosettes look as if
they've melted,

but it's a lovely shiny ganache.

[Paul] Let's have a look.

[Prue] The layers look thicker
in the middle.

They're certainly a bit compressed
towards the edge.

-It's domed rather than flat.
-[Prue] Yeah.

-It does taste good, doesn't it?
-It does.

Erm, this is more like it, actually.

-[Prue] It's also flat on top.
-[Paul] Nice sides.

-It's got a nice chocolate flavour.
-Excellent.

[Paul] I like this, it's quite neat.

The effect is quite nice, but you could
just run a palette knife around there

and just straighten that off a little bit.

Let's have a look inside, shall we?

That's very nice
and mousse-y, the chocolate filling.

Nice texture to that sponge.
Chocolate comes through well.

-Ganache is lovely.
-Mmm.

Moving on to number four.

You have a nice shine on this.
Nice straight sides.

Although, what happened to the rosettes?

-It's a nice sponge.
-[Prue] Mmm-hmm.

-[Paul] It's well-baked.
-[Prue] It's nice and fluffy.

But it's got a bit of bite to it.

[Paul] Okay, moving on again.

-Quite small, this one.
-[Prue] Yeah.

It's either very compressed
or the layers were very thin.

You have a hugely thick layer,
very thin. Thin, thin, thin.

Big and erratic on the chocolate.

Tastes great though.

It just doesn't look as consistent
as some of the others.

Why is there cream on the top?

And there's something really
seriously wrong with theâ¦

ganache. It's not quite smooth.

[Paul] All the filling is split.

-Oh, yeah.
-Probably why there's cream on top.

-It's a bit tough as well.
-Very tough.

[Prue] This one's a bit wobbly.

[Paul] Instead of straight sides,
it is domed, isn't it?

[Prue] It's domed
and the outside is a bit uneven.

[Paul] Yep.

Mmm. Nice flavour.

[Paul] It's a shame
it looks the way it does.

-[Prue] Yeah.
-[Paul] Finally, the last one.

-[Prue] Ganache is a bit bubbly.
-[Paul] But the sides are quite neat.

And we're missing a few, erm, crowns.

-[Paul] Very equal sponge.
-[Prue] Yeah, nice sponge.

-That's delicious. Beautiful.
-[Paul] Mmm.

Ah! Interesting. Okay!

[Noel] Prue and Paul will now rank
the Prinzregententorte from worst to best.

Okay, in eighth spot we have this one.

Whose is this? Amanda?

You had a lot of bubbles on the top.
The inside was all split.

-And cream?
-Sorry.

In seventh spot, we have this one.

Crystelle, the top has melted a little bit
and it's pretty messy.

[Matt] George is sixth, Freya fifth.

JÃ¼rgen's fourth and Lizzie comes third.

In second spot, we have this one.
Whose is this?

Pretty good, Chigs.
The layers are beautifully soft.

-I think it looks pretty good.
-Thank you.

Which meansâ¦

[contestants clapping]

[Prue] Giuseppe.

The ganache is absolutely beautiful,
the sponge is lovely.

The layers are absolutely even.
Takes an Italian to make a German cake.

[all chuckling]

[laughs]

I was really, really surprised.
I was not expecting that.

The first placeâ¦

I'm not so much into chocolate cakes.

When I go to German cafes,

I usually have cream cakes
or black forest.

Because everyone's Signature
was so good this morning,

I feel like I'm treading on
thin ice now, which is quite scary.

There's still tomorrow.

Hopefully I'll pull it out of the bag
on the day, and everything will be okay.

[Matt] One challenge remains.

One last chance
to secure a place in the tent.

Hello, bakers.

Welcome back to the tent
for your Showstopper Challenge.

Today, the judges would love you
to make a spectacular yeast-leavened cake.

[Matt] Now, your cake
should be a minimum of two tiers,

and should be inspired
by one of the many yeasted cakes

that are so popular in Germany.

-Ever been to Germany, Noel?
-I have, actually.

Lots of times. I'm actually German.

-Really?
-Yeah. My dad invented the Kinder Egg.

-Did he?
-No, of course he didn't.

If he did, I wouldn't be here.

I would be on my luxury private yacht
as we speak.

[Matt] You'd have to build it yourself
first, wouldn't you?

Get all the pieces
and put the stickers on.

-[Noel] You have four and a half hours.
-[Matt] On your marks.

-Get set.
-Bake!

This is a first for me.
I've never done a yeast-leavened cake.

I genuinely don't know
what it's supposed to be like.

It's a bit like bread.
It's all about rising times.

-And proving.
-It's a bit of a faff, isn't it?

If you want to make a Victoria's sponge,
an hour, it's done.

This could take all day.
Or four and a half hours.

Traditionally, cakes as we think of them
are raised with baking powder.

Now, in Germany,
you do make cakes using yeast.

[Prue] The perfect yeasted cake
has the stretchiness of bread,

but it's still rich and cake-like.
It's quite difficult to get.

They've got four and a half hours.

A lot of that will be
down to proving the dough.

It's not a cake where you just produce it,

put it in the oven, bake it up.

But they've got to allow time
to produce a highly decorative cake.

What we're asking them to do
is to zizz it up,

make it something really festive or funny,

just generally over-the-top.
We want something amazing.

-[Paul] Morning, JÃ¼rgen.
-Morning, Paul.

-Hello, JÃ¼rgen.
-Morning, Prue.

JÃ¼rgen, will you tell us
about your yeast cake, please?

Yes. So, in Germany,
you wouldn't do a tiered yeasted cake.

No, we've anglicised it.

-[JÃ¼rgen] Yes. Yes.
-Which I apologise for.

It's like being asked to make
a three-tier apple crumbleâ¦

-[laughing]
-â¦or a three-tiered trifle.

[Matt] The three braided tiers
of JÃ¼rgen's yeasted cake

will be packed with chocolate raisins
and apricot jam,

and he's flavouring his dough
with a healthy dose of Bavarian booze.

Now, I've made dough with stouts
and it tends to slow it up a bit.

How are you combating that?

I didn't have a problem with that.

-No.
-Hopefully, it'll pack a punch.

-Look forward to it.
-Thank you.

[Matt] JÃ¼rgen might be
taking his dough for a quiet pint,

but Lizzie's hitting the hard stuff.

So I'm soaking my raisins
in orange blossom and Mandarin gin,

and it's got a gin syrup as well.

They'll be just off their faces.

[Noel] Lizzie's gin-soaked raisins will be
folded into a cinnamon-yeasted cake.

Cream cheese frosting
and pineapple flowers

will complete a three-tiered rendering
of Hansel and Gretel.

Your flavours have been getting really
good recently, so it's about decoration.

-It's about that little bit of finesse.
-Yeah. Which I lack.

-It's aboutâ¦
-Paul, look at all these colours.

It's going to be a colour explosion.

You're quite lucky, because Paul's
just told us he's colour-blind.

[all laughing]

[Matt] Lizzie's not the only baker

using boozy berries
to give her cake a kick.

You do need to keep it moist,
so I have been forced

to use a whole kilo of raisins

soaked in a litre of very good rum.

[Matt] Amanda's rum-soaked raisin cake

will be enhanced
by a layer of caramelised spiced plums

and decorated
with ornate Edelweiss flowers.

Edelweiss, there's a song about it
in The Sound of Music.

George knows all the words.
George, isn't that right?

You know all the words to Edelweiss
from The Sound of Music?

Well, yeah,
you've been playing it since we got here.

[chuckling]

He's such a liar.

[JÃ¼rgen] It's going to get noisy.

I have quite a powerful kneading method,
which is called the French Slap.

[Amanda] I think I'm going to take
a victim statement from that dough.

Violent.

[Matt] However vigorously
the bakers choose to handle their dough,

kneading it is crucial.

I want it to be, like, tacky
and, like, relatively sort of smooth.

[Matt] But it's a tricky balance.

[George] Doughy goodness.

[Matt] Knead too forcefully,

and they risk a texture
that's more bread-like than cake.

If you do this reasonably,
it helps creating the structure

within the dough that holds the air.

[Matt] But too delicate,

and their dough will collapse
as it proves.

[Crystelle] Mine is kind of
like a brioche dough.

I don't really over-knead it
because it ends up being really sticky.

But again, I just don't know
what the texture's supposed to be like.

So maybe I should be working a bit more.

[Noel] Layers of caramelised apple
and vanilla and chocolate creme diplomat

will separate the three tiers
of Crystelle's brioche-style bake.

It's the bread we're judging
and I do think brioche is the best bread.

It is a hybrid between bread and cake.

It's very difficult
and I've never had one before,

so I don't know
if it's just a dry cake or a weird bread,

-but hopefully you'll like it.
-Good luck.

Thank you very much. Thanks.

[Matt] While Crystelle's hoping to give
her cake the texture of a French classic,

Giuseppe is attempting to mimic
an Italian favourite.

The closest Italian relative
to the yeasted cake is the pandoro,

so I've used that as a baseline.

I'm trying to get as close as possible
to a pandoro texture.

[Matt] Piped with amarena-soaked cherries,
Giuseppe's yeast-leavened cake

will be soaked in honey and filled
with a vanilla creme patisserie.

Imagine if you get Star Baker this week
in German week,

JÃ¼rgen's going to be fuming.

How will that manifest itself?

[mimicking JÃ¼rgen]
"Very disappointed, Giuseppe."

[Giuseppe laughing]
He's a really lovely guy.

He gave us all private tutoring sessions
for German names.

That's really nice.

Because he could have just gone,
"Oh, this is to my advantage."

If they have Italian week,
will you be doing that for everyone?

-No way.
-[laughs]

Of course I would. Why not?

-Cut them dead.
-[both chuckle]

[whistling]

Matthew, hold this.
The next time call's in that jar.

Whatever you do, don't open the lid.

-I'll be back in a minute.
-Okay.

[Noel's voice echoing]
Bakers, you are halfway through.

Matthew, I will kill thee.

Right, next.

[Matt] While the bakers' dough
will demonstrate a mastery of texture,

the fillings are a chance
to show off flavours.

Chocolate filling done.
This is going to be messy.

I want a nice, equal distribution
of the filling

and it's always a little bit of a gamble.

[George] This is my one of my wife's
favourite flavours.

She's obsessed with chocolate,
so I'm going to fill it,

one layer, with, like, full chocolate.

The next one is going to be tahini,
because she loves tahini.

And then the top, I'm just gonna do
a chocolate-tahini combo,

kind of mix them together.

[Noel] George's three-tier
chocolate and tahini cake

will be glazed in a vanilla icing
and decorated with sugar paste roses

as a belated wedding anniversary
gift for his wife, Oslin.

This is really nice.
How long have you been married?

Erm, fifâ¦ Fourteen years.

-Shall we ask you that again?
-Fourtâ¦

I got married in 2008.

Why are you doing this to me
on camera, Paul?

-[Paul] I'm not.
-Why, Paul?

-I'm just trying to getâ¦
-My wife watches this.

Should we do it again,
pretend it didn't happen?

Yeah, I need to know this stuff.

So, George, how long you been married?

-I just asked you that question.
-I know, is it 14?

-I'm not feeling well.
-[all laughing]

[Noel] Thirteen.

[Matt] While George's focus is fillings,

Chigs' attention has turned to toppings.

[Chigs] So this is going to be
the mixed nuts topping.

So that's honey and butter
and crushed almonds,

pecans and walnuts,
and that will sit on each level.

So you'll have a crunch on the top.

[Noel] Chigs' crunchy topping

will give way to
a honey and mixed peel cake

filled with lemon creme diplomat

and decorated with white chocolate
honeycomb and marzipan flowers.

So this will go on top, we'll have
a soft, pillowy dough in the middle.

-Filled with fruit.
-Mmm.

-Soft, pillowy dough.
-Yes.

-You're talking like this show talks.
-[laughs]

"We would like a soft, pillowy dough."

Really? Do you really
want it to taste of pillows?

-Ermâ¦
-"Quite dry, quite clothy."

-I won't be trying your bake.
-Ermâ¦ Okay. sorry.

[Noel] Chigs might be planning
a nutty crunch for the top of his bake,

but Freya's gambling
with an intentional soggy bottom.

I'm kind of making it
like an upside down plum cake.

So I'm pouring the red wine in the bottom.

Not a wine connoisseur,
to be honest with you,

but 'cause it's German red wine,

I feel like
that probably means it's fancy.

[Matt] The three tiers
of Freya's yeasted cake

will be topped with poached plums
and soaked in a spiced wine syrup.

[Freya] The goal is
kind of to, like, stretch it out

on top of the red wine,
so it should soak it up perfectly.

Otherwise, it could
all just run everywhere.

All right, that's all ready.

[Matt] With yeasted cake batter plaited,

packed with fillings or soaked in alcohol,
the proving can begin.

So this is where the timing becomes
critical, because it's going to beâ¦

I'm going to be more than
halfway through the challenge,

and I haven't even started baking yet.

[Freya] Right,
they're going in for half an hour.

[Noel] While the dough rests,
the bakers must labour onâ¦

I'm now gonna start to make my flower.

â¦making decorations that will elevate
their cakes to Showstopper status.

I'm doing pineapple flowers,
put the pineapples on,

and then heat them low,
and they should turn into flowers.

Well, I've never made flowers in my life.
It's a little bit fiddly for me.

[Freya] Oh, I absolutely love doing this.

[chuckling] To be honest,
I make it up as I go.

You know, we're nearly halfway
through this competition.

-I know! How crazy is that?
-[Noel] And you're still here.

I said that to my mum
and she was like, "Don't worry, Freya,

your dad can come and get you on Tuesday."

[both chuckling]

I've never heard a cuter sentence.

[slurred] Bakers,
you've got one hour left.

[Noel laughing]

Ay, and we have dough.

So my dough has risen, which is great.

Just arranging my caramelised plums.

Gonna sprinkle some more sugar
and cinnamon on top

so it caramelises
a little bit in the oven.

All that needs to be done is egg washing
before it goes in the oven.

[Matt] Multiple cakes of varying sizes

means managing
individual bake times is tricky.

[George] This is going to overflow.

And requires precision planning.

I'll take the first one out
after 20 minutes, the smallest one.

And the next one I'll leave
for a further five minutes.

The other one I'll leave
for another five minutes.

[Matt] But Freya's got other ideas.

[Freya] There we go.

To be honest with you,
they do actually bake like pretty similar

because the little one is so small,
but it's a bit deeper.

So, yeah,
they're not that much different at all.

Just a nice little break, isn't it?

Yeah, the very first we had in this tent.

Yeah, this bit's kind of, like,
chilled at the moment, but we'll see.

Listen, I think the secret to
a good yeasted cake is being patient.

I'm just saying that
to make myself feel better.

[Noel] What did you just say to me?

"Don't bring
your erratic behaviour in here."

-Yeah. Over here.
-In this zone.

-Created a little calm zone.
-Yeah, I'm quite chilled.

I can be calm.

-Can you?
-Yeah.

I feel like your mum and dad
used to play that competition a lot,

like, "Who can be
the quietest the longest?"

"Let's go."

You'd just be sat there shaking,
bottling it up.

[laughing]

How very dare you!

I'm just checking on it.
It should be coming out in two minutes.

[Matt] While most of the bakers
are managing to hold their nerveâ¦

-[George] Let's take these babies out.
-â¦George can't wait any longer.

[Chigs] Are they baked?

[George] I don't know.
But I need to start decorating.

Bakers, you have half an hour left.

[Chigs] I'm gonna give it
another couple minutes.

[Giuseppe] In 40 seconds,
I'm going to be taking the large one out.

I keep questioning this big one
because it's so big.

The last thing you want
is him saying, "It's raw."

They look fine on top. Gotta make sure
they're done all the way through.

[Lizzie] Paul said, "Show finesse."

Oh, no!

"Finesse."

Can you have much finesse
with a broken cake?

Bakers, you have ten minutes left.

Amanda, you've got nine.

Wonder if I overdid the wine.
As long as the middle is cooked.

I think we're gonna try and assemble this.

Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it.

Needs more time.
I'll give it another five.

[Chigs] So this is gonna be
the chocolate honeycomb.

Melted already, I can feel it.

Done.

Right! It's too hot
to put the butter icing on.

[Giuseppe]
This is the cream in the middle.

[George] Come on, come on. I'm shaking.

[Amanda] It's too hot.

-[Lizzie] My pineapple flowers.
-[Crystelle] Okay, roses, roses, roses.

Done!

[Amanda] I thought for once,
I'd have a tidy bench.

[groaning] Why is it falling?

Oh, my gosh!

Bakers, your time is up.

Please step away from your bakes.

[Freya] Oh, look at that. Wow!

I think I wentâ¦ You know
when we were like, "Oh, do more wine"?

-Yeah.
-You should see it.

It's dripping in wine.
I think that's better.

[Matt] The bakers' yeast-leavened cakes
now face the judgment of Paul and Prue.

Okay, bakers, Noel is feeling
a little under the weather.

But we're going to carry on
and invite Lizzie up to the front.

With your Showstopper, please.

[Paul] I like it.
I think you've made a real attempt

to create that finesse
that we're looking for. All right.

[Prue] Let's have a look.

[Paul] You ended up
with something very, very nice.

So you don't get that chew.
You get a cake-like quality.

I think it needs a little more sweetness,
either in a glaze or an icing.

But it's very nice and very pleasant.

-Well done.
-[Paul] Thank you, Lizzie.

I like the look of that.
The roses coming all the way down.

I like the uniformity of it.
As a package, it works together.

[Prue] This is the apple one?

[Crystelle] Yeah.
The cinnamon apples are in the centre

and the cream is piped 'round the outside.

[Prue] This is about as fattening
a mouthful as you could get.

The cream, the apple and cinnamon
work beautifully together.

I love the structure as well,
because it's quite light on the mouth.

Delicious.

Good job, Crystelle.

[Prue] Very good job.

[Paul] It's quite pretty.
It's a bit dark. It's been overbaked.

Okay.

You can see how dark that is in places.
But I like the design though, it's clever.

[Prue] I like the crystallized candy peel,
it's really good.

But it's quite a tough eat, isn't it?

It's dry. Flavours are good, idea's good.

It's the overbaking that's done it for me.

-Thank you, Chigs.
-Thank you, guys. Thank you very much.

It's quite effective.
Not very neat down at the bottom.

But you can cover up a world of problems
with almonds on the outside.

But its dependent on the flavour.

[Prue] That's a lot of fruit.

-Flavour's fantastic.
-That's beautiful.

The structure is perfect.
The bite is perfect.

The bake is spot-on.

I've never had anything
quite like that before.

Thank you.

[Paul] It's not
the best-looking thing I've seen.

But it's one of the best-tasting things
I've had for a long time.

Thank you so much.

[Paul] There's so much bleeding
coming from the plums.

[Prue] It is a bit messy-looking.

[Paul] If you had water icing
around the outside of each one,

it'd look neater.

[Prue] Should we taste it?

[Paul] Let's have a look.

The syrupy topping
is delicious, unusual and lovely.

But there's an awful lot
of dough to topping.

And I think it could have done
with a little more baking.

-[Paul] Yeah, it's too doughy.
-Yeah, it is underbaked.

-Yeah, it is.
-Got it.

-Thank you
-Thank you.

[Matt] Well done.

[Prue] I think it's very pretty.

It does look like an anniversary cake.

-[Paul] You need a stronger colour there.
-[George] Yeah.

See the colour you managed
to achieve down here?

You want the same up there.
You can see how light that is.

It's almost been treated like a soft roll.

-[George] Yeah.
-[Paul] All right.

[Prue] Let's have a look.

I love the flavour.
Chocolate-tahini balance is perfect.

[Paul] That's, ermâ¦ That's a raw dough.

-Oh, is it?
-[Prue] The middle is raw.

I think it's a bit clumsy,
it's been rushed.

-Thank you.
-Thank you

[Prue] I think it looks absolutely lovely.
I really do.

And it's holding very well.
It doesn't seem to be squashing.

[Paul] I wanna go
straight down to the bottom.

-[all exclaiming]
-Well held.

[Giuseppe] Thank you.

Well, I ain't letting no cake go to waste.
Not on my watch.

[all laughing]

[Prue] That looks really lovely.
Light, it's almost like a panettone.

It's better than a panettone, that.

It's almost like a whisked sponge.
The cherries are delicious.

Nice and tart, but they're sweet
at the same time.

It's delicious. I think you've
done an amazing job.

-[Prue] Well done, Giuseppe.
-[Paul] Thank you, Giuseppe.

[Prue] I must say,
I think it looks really beautiful.

It's a lovely colour.

[Paul] I can't wait to see
what it looks like inside.

It's quite a breakfasty bake.

You think it's too bready?

It is very bready.
It's a little bit dry.

You have to be really delicate with this
sort of thing to get the air in it.

That could have opened up
considerably more to make it much lighter.

But the flavour is good.
Overall, I like it.

But I don't love it, which is a shame.

It probably could have been lighter.

It could have been in the oven less,
but I feel proud of what I've produced.

[Freya] I just loved it.

To be totally flat-out honest,
that's what I hoped it'd look like.

In fact, I wouldn't have
wanted it to look any different

[George] I'm gutted. I'm really gutted.

Definitely feel I'm in danger.
Like, more than ever.

Yeah, I feel a bit sick.

Let's talk about
who's in line for Star Baker.

Giuseppe's done really well.

I mean, he's really beginning
to get into his stride now.

Could be one to watch.

I think overall JÃ¼rgenâ¦
JÃ¼rgen's done all right, actually.

-He had a handshake yesterday.
-He did.

I was a little bit disappointed
with his Showstopper.

But it looked so beautiful.
Because we think JÃ¼rgen is so good,

when he doesn't do something perfectly,
we bang on about it.

-That's still a very good yeasted cake.
-Yeah.

[Paul] I was a little bit
upset with George.

You know, they were doughy.
I think Freya's down there as well,

because Freya's Showstopper
wasn't as good as I was expecting.

[Prue] It was such a pity because
the actual syrup was delicious.

But it was that much cake
and a tiny bit of topping.

[Paul] In Star Baker position,
you've got Giuseppe, JÃ¼rgen,

and George and Freya down at the bottom.

Well, bakers,
thank you so much for joining us

for two gruelling days in this hot tent.

Now the Star Baker this week isâ¦

-Is Giuseppe, congratulations.
-[all clapping]

[murmurs indistinctly]

And now we have to lose someone.

This gets harder and harder.

And the person
that we are losing this week

is someone who's brought
their own ideas into the tent.

And we're very, very sorry to see them go.

I'm afraid the person
who is leaving us this week isâ¦

Is Freya.

-Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
-[sobbing]

I'm really sad Freya's going.
My God, she is so talented.

You are literally
the most put-together 19-year-old

I've ever met in my entire life.

That wait was agonising.

I thought, "I'm waiting
for my name to be called,

I'm waiting for my name,"
and then, you know, poor Freya.

Really gutted for her.

[Paul] It's very sad that Freya had to go.
She's done an amazing job.

She's 19 years old, vegan baking,
and she came halfway.

There you go. That's how good she is.

Should be really proud of yourself.

-Thank you.
-[Paul] Really proud of yourself.

Genuinely, I think it's the best
experience of my life.

[Prue] You know, you've done so well.

I was feeling
the lack of experience quite a lot.

So, you know, I am 19.

So I do feel really proud
to have even just been able to keep up.

So, like, to get to week five
and do it vegan,

erm, I just feel like I really have
done what I wanted to do being here.

[all] It's only vegan chocolate cake!

Giuseppe, he's done it again.

Giuseppe absolutely deserved
Star Baker. Yes. [chuckles]

Second Star Baker.

I can'tâ¦ [clicks tongue]
I can't believe that.

I want to think only of the next step,

so next week, it's gonna put me under
a lot of pressure to perform well,

and that's, ermâ¦

A difficult position to start in.

It's Pastry Week and the bakers tackle signature choux pastry doughnuts and a tricky Turkish technical, before making a savory, delicately designed showstopping pie packed full of flavor.
Hello, Matthew Lucas.
It's Pastry Week!

Are you excited? Yes, I am excited.

For I have here a shoe pastry.

But I very much hope I don't
get the laces stuck in my teeth.

Welcome to
The Great British Bake Off.

Mmm, nice.

Last time...
Why is it falling?

..the bakers battled
Bavarian delicacies.

Oh, no!

While Jurgen got off to
a strong start...

You've done well there, Jurgen.



..it was Giuseppe
who claimed the German crown.

It's delicious. I think
you've done an amazing job.

And with a soggy Showstopper...
Wonder if I overdid the wine.

..Freya became the latest baker
to leave the tent.

It's only vegan chocolate cake!

Now...
Just wanna give it a little love.

..the bakers tackle pastry.

Can I just say I think you've
invented like a new dance move here?

Do you think?
..as it's fried...

I feel like I'm having
heart palpitations.

..folded... Filo pastry.
Never made it in my life.

..and filled.
Can't tell what's sausage

and what's hands,
to be honest with you.

Who will perfect pastry?



Oh, it collapsed.

I can't watch.
I know. it's too stressful.

And who has baked their last?

Have you seen this here?

This is week six.
The second half of the journey.

I'm performing much better
than I expected.

In fact,
I have to keep buying shirts

cos I didn't bring enough
with me.

I've managed to worm my way through
cos there's been loads of people,

but now it's getting less,
it's harder.

I spoke to Lizzie and I was like,
"Come on, Lizzie, we cannot back
down.

"We've got to do it for Freya,

"like, come on, like,
the women have got to do it."

I think Amanda might be able
to pull it out of the bag.

I think pastry week's her week.

No-one's given up in there.
I'm certainly not giving up.

Hello, bakers,
welcome back to the tent.

It's Pastry Week.

It's time for your
Signature Challenge.

Paul and Prue
would like you each to make

two batches of decorated chouxnuts.

Did you know that
Paul Hollywood invented

the chouxnut pouch?

He had some spare leather
and nowhere to put his nuts.

No, you're thinking of
the jock strap, Noel. Oh, yeah.

Now, your chouxnuts
need to be perfectly fried.

Six filled, six not filled.

And either glazed or iced.

You have two hours.

On your marks.
Get set.

Uh, uh, uh, wait, Chigs.
Cos I haven't said it yet.

LAUGHTER

Not my time you're wasting.

Bake!

A chouxnut is much lighter
than a doughnut.

It's almost like a fried eclair.

I actually prefer the chouxnut
to doughnuts.

Yeah. I like eating them.

I'm not a choux-nutter, at all.

I mean, if I went to hell, I feel
like this is what my hell would be.

If you've never heard of
a chouxnut before,

basically it's choux pastry
piped into a doughnut shape,

deep-fried.
We want two batches.

One of them has
to have filling inside

and one of them has to have

a really interesting icing
or glaze.

The chouxnuts themselves
are quite aerated.

You want that beautiful aeration
inside the chouxnut.

Choux has to be exactly
the right consistency.

So getting the paste right
is most important.

If it's too wet,
it's going to sink.

Morning, Lizzie. Morning.

Right, Lizzie, chouxnuts.
Chouxnuts.

Oh, the devil's doughnuts.

They have me shook already.
I'm like shaken.

What she's saying is
she's quite upset about it.

LAUGHTER

So tell us about your flavours.

So I'm doing raspberry liqueur
and hibiscus

for the filled one.

OK. Oh, lovely. OK. That sounds
absolutely delicious.

Lizzie's raspberry liqueur
and hibiscus-filled chouxnuts

will be paired with
a caramel-glazed unfilled batch.

But she's more confident with
her flavours than with the fryer.

So why have you found this
to be a problem?

I just hate choux pastry
and I just feel like

the fryer's gonna like hit me
and I'm gonna burn.

Feels like you're in a chippy,
doesn't it? God, yeah.

The pressure is just unbelievable.
Even my elbows are sweating.

Your elbows are sweating? Yeah.

Never heard about sweaty elbows.

Good name for a punk band,
that, the Sweaty Elbows.

It's going to be fine.
Oh, hopefully.

Lizzie might be dreading
the fryer,

but one baker
couldn't be more excited.

Gorgeous. Can you smell
that frying oil?

Can't wait to make this. Yummy.

OK, so one I'm doing
a classic sticky toffee.

I'm making a really easy toffee

just because of
the time pressure in here.

And it's also all about
my pastry today.

George is keeping
his flavours simple

with one toffee-glazed choux batch

and another filled with
jam and cream.

Today he's focusing on his flavours
to impress Paul and Prue.

Tell us about the pastry.

Um, I, I just wanted to get
a nice airy dough.

Poker face.

Look at George's
questioning eyes,

"Is that OK?" Getting nothing.

You're not doing this to me,
Paul.

Perfect choux is light and airy,

characterised by large holes
on the inside.

We fold air in and then just
give it a really good mix.

Egg is vital
to bind the ingredients,

helping it to puff up when fried.

This is the bit that
can go wrong the most

out of the whole process
cos if you add too many eggs,

the batter becomes runny and you
will not be able to shape it.

It's a fine line.
More egg means more liquid

which could lead to chouxnuts
that are as flat as a pancake.

You kind of have to do this by eye.

Um, and obviously baking
is all about precision.

You should be able to pick it up
and it drips into a V.

Yeah. Done.

But Chigs' dough isn't done.

I'm making a chocolate dough.

That one will be a little bit
tougher because of the cocoa powder.

So I will add a bit more egg in.
I just need to be careful with it.

His chocolate pastry
will form his unfilled chouxnut,

topped with a lime glaze.

But Chigs is the only baker
braving two different pastries.

His plain batch will be filled
with hazelnut praline,

evoking the French classic
the Paris-Brest.

Right, I'm gonna start making pastry
for the Paris-Brest flavour.

The what, sorry? Paris-Brest.

Parry Brea... what?
Yes, that's right.

It's got breasts in it?
Too much for my head.

Bakers, you are halfway through.

EXHALES

Look at Jurgen's stance.

Yes, action stance.

There's a lot to do.
Come on, come on.

While Chigs races to finish
his second batch of pastry,

the rest of the bakers
have bagged theirs up...

Done. Right, I'm just gonna make
my glaze.

..and are pushing on with
their toppings and fillings.

Time for Italian alcohol.

Er, I thought it would have been
unacceptable

for an Italian
to come on Bake Off

and not use limoncello somewhere,
and this seemed to be

the right excuse to get some in
the ingredients list.

Giuseppe's bringing the taste of
Italy to his chouxnuts

with a filled batch packed
with limoncello liqueur

and the other topped
with almond nougatine.

I'm making both batches
with standard flavours

I'm most familiar with, you know,
to play it safe and to do,

to go with something
that I knew already.

But one baker who isn't
playing it safe is Crystelle.

I wanted something
completely different

so I've gone for miso caramel,
salty sweet chouxnut.

Hopefully it works.

Er, it shouldn't taste
of miso soup, I hope.

A passion fruit
and mango-filled choux

will sit alongside another
glazed in a novel miso caramel.

Tell me about the miso.

I feel like miso caramel's
kind of like just a step up

from salted caramel.
So miso's quite umami.

You kind of get this salty
umami undertone.

"Lovely umami undertone."

LAUGHTER

No more middle class-sentence
has ever been uttered.

That's not something
you'd hear every day.

Right, thanks, Noel.

But Crystelle isn't the only baker
riding the sweet and savoury trend.

This one's going to be glazed
with maple syrup

with some bacon on the top.
It's delicious.

Amanda's planning to pair
her maple and bacon glazed chouxnut

with another batch
filled with pistachio and rose.

What sweet and savoury mixes
could we invent?

Jam and sausage?
Jam sausage?

What about chocolate onion?

Probably not. No, I'm not liking
the sound of that one.

No. Sweet and savoury's a terrible
idea. Yeah, whose idea was that?

When it comes to
weird and wonderful flavours,

Jurgen's pushing the boat out
even further.

This is ube extract
from a purple Filipine yam

which has a vanilla-y,
quite unique flavour.

Also the colour
should be stunning.

He's making a yuzu
and sake glazed choux

to pair with his ube-filled batch,

the bright colours
mimicking pastries

he ate as a child in the '70s.

Well, that's an amazing colour.

On top of the purple colour

the glaze will be orange
as well.

LAUGHTER All right, Jurgen,

we'll look forward to
your '70s psychedelic dyes.

You've already won for me.
That colour's so strong.

Right, I'm just trying to completely
make sure they're fried.

Do you fry a lot?

No, no. No.
I don't own one of them at home.

No, I don't. I own two.

Ha-ha.

Bakers, you have half an hour.

No pressure.

I'm sure it'll be fine.

Just piping my choux dough
nicely and gently.

Paul and Prue are expecting
uniform chouxnuts...

I'm making sure the shape
is as consistent as possible.

..fried to perfection.

Fryers scare me.
I'm literally shaking.

Lizzie? Yeah.
Don't worry. Have confidence.

Let's go, let's go.

Each fried chouxnut needs to be
crunchy on the outside,

light and fluffy in the middle.

You don't know
when chouxnuts are done.

No-one knows.

I'm sure one of these knows.

They need at least five minutes

otherwise they will then
collapse afterwards.

Not only is the frying time
critical,

the oil temperature
must also be correct.

I'm aiming for 175.
Nice and hot.

Just want a little bit of brown
on the edge.

Achieving the perfect chouxnut
is no mean feat

when the bakers still have
toppings to prepare.

Ridiculous - still making the glaze
for the chocolate ones.

So many elements.

I feel like I'm having
heart palpitations.

Multi-tasking is a bit of
a challenge. Right...

Oh, see, look, I didn't start
the bloody timer.

My last... It's fine, it's fine.

I'll, I'll just hope and pray.
Maybe I'll do two minutes.

These tongs are hot.

Ooh!

How do you open this thing?

Hmm?

Push it in.

OK.

Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

Come on.

That's exactly what I wanted
to get.

Seems to be a good golden colour.

Shame about the light colour.

But never mind.

I can't even look at you,
you're making me sweat more.

What, in the elbows?

Yeah. Maybe I've got issues.

Right, filling.
♪ You've got to pump it up... ♪

The filled chouxnuts
must be crammed full of cream.

Crucial moment.

But the more they inject,
the more chance of an explosion.

Oh, my God, it's all coming out.
What?

Jeez.

So this is the last
filled chouxnut.

Why is so much coming out?
Oops.

OK, passion juice
in the crinkly ball.

The crinkly ball, the passion juice
comes out. Yeah, it's quite nice.

I like that. It is nice.

Limoncello. This is gonna be
a very, very close call.

How long we got left now?

One minute left.

Oh, no, oh, no.
Rush at the end.

They're nearly done.

Come on. There's no time
to waste!

Bakers, your time is up.

Can you stop touching your nuts,
please?

George! I'm eating it.

Don't touch any of your nuts.
I'm not touching.

Lizzie, will you try
any of your nuts?

Absolutely not.

They are horrible.

I think they're a bit soggy.
They're just underfried.

A rookie error in this competition,
just not setting the timer.

The bakers' chouxnuts will now face
the judgment of Paul and Prue.

Hello, George.
Hello, George. Hi, hiya.

You've got a
nice robust mixture there

which has given you that pop.

This is a toffee and hazelnut
chouxnut. These are not filled.

Mm.

Toffee-ish, really nutty.

Goes nicely with the soft choux.
Delicious. Lovely.

Let's have a
look at your filled one.

It's got a Chantilly cream with
raspberry jam rippled through.

You've given me an empty bit.

It's important you get the filling
right the way round. Yeah.

Quite often I need two holes
so that I can squirt.

You squeeze the bag. Yeah.

When you meet that
little bit of resistance,

it usually means it's full.

STIFLED LAUGHTER

Why are you laughing?

We're just children.

You're grown up.

Sorry, Dame Prue.
Exactly. Stop this nonsense.

Tell him it's lovely.

I think when you do... Sorry.

I think when you do get the cream
filling and the jam, it's delicious.

Thank you.

The filled ones
have an ube creme pat.

That ube colour is just
extraordinary, isn't it?

That slightly vanillary ube
taste is... unusual,

but sort of vaguely familiar.

I think the, the structure on that
is very good.

It's nice and open. It's very light.
It's so delicate it's lovely. OK.

These are the unfilled ones.
They have a yuzu and sake glaze.

It has that little bit of acidity
which yuzu gives it.

They're both delicious. Thank you.

The filled ones,
they are Paris-Brest inspired.

I've got a praline
cream in the middle.

Can't really see the structure,
cos there's so much of the filling!

I think Paris-Brest should have
lots of filling.

That's delicious. Mm.

This is my chocolate lime chouxnut.

The cocoa, that's just enough
to marry with the lime. Yeah.

It's unusual, but it does work.

It's a nice chouxnut, that one.
Thank you.

It's delicate.

So, those are the empty chouxnuts
with an almond praline.

Good frying.

Colour's nice, isn't it?

The contrast of the praline crunch

and the softness of the choux
is just lovely.

OK. Let's have a look at your filled
one. Creme pat and limoncello.

It's definitely creme pat
with limoncello!

There is too much limoncello -
and I can't resist another mouthful.

Aha! Mm.

This is the miso... caramel.
And white chocolate, yeah.

It is exactly how you said.
It's umami.

It's got... you know it has got
that bitterness to it. Mm-hm.

And the tropical passion fruit
choux is just beautiful.

But the choux itself... Mm.
..is very tight.

Yeah. It's not open enough.

It should be, "pff".
You've lost a lot of the definition.

Do you think you lost some of the
definition in the frying? Yeah.

You need to give it a bit of a...
Yeah... hit.

The choux's let you down
a little bit. OK, thank you.

OK. The maple bacon.

It needs the bacon.
Could've done with a tiny bit more.

Yeah - that's a shame,
cos I had so much left over. Yeah.

Well, let's have a
look at your filled one.

It's pistachio creme pat
with a rose glaze.

The, uh, rose, it's like, artificial
cordial. Too rosy and too sweet. OK.

Quite attractive.

The frying colour looks good.

Mm.

Hibiscus and what?

Raspberry liqueur.

The hibiscus flavour's quite nice
and so's the raspberry.

Overall it's got a nice
structure to it.

It's delicate, and the
toffee is delicious, as well.

I would buy these in a shop.
That's for sure.

Thank you, I've been in panic.

You're ruining my lifetime's theory

that you cannot cook
if you don't love it.

Well done. Thank you. Anyway,
well done. Ta. Well done. Ta.

Feel so sick.

Great stuff, well done.

That was my best Signature feedback.

I thought I was gonna, like, pass
out when they were speaking to me.

I just couldn't believe what
they were saying.

I don't think they were overly
enamoured with the rose flavour,

but that's OK.

Gotta try these things, haven't you?

My choux pastry wasn't up to
scratch, and it's Pastry Week -

but I'm gonna have to try and pull
it out of the bag in the Technical.

I just need to tell myself I have a
functioning brain

and hopefully my brain'll function

and I will do a Technical Challenge
successfully.

The bakers were able to
practise their chouxnuts,

but have no idea what awaits them
in the Technical Challenge.

Bakers, welcome back to the tent
for your Technical Challenge,

which today has been
set by Holly Paulwood.

Holly, any words of advice?

This particular recipe
will push you to your limits.

Don't waste any time.

Thank you, Holly, and may I say
you're looking gorgeous tonight?!

Now, as ever, the Technical
Challenge will be judged blind,

so we're gonna have to ask Holly
and Prue to leave the tent.

Off you pop.

The judges would love you to make
a large baklava with filo pastry.

Oh, no! Oh, man.

Your filo pastry should be made

using a traditional
laminating technique

layered with a pistachio
and walnut filling

and cut into a star design.

You have 2 hours and 45 minutes.
On your marks. Get set. Bake!

Oh, Jesus.

Filo pastry is
notoriously complicated.

Filo pastry?
Never made it in my life.

Who makes their own filo pastry?

No-one.

This is the first time ever the
bakers have been asked to make it

for a Technical Challenge.

I've never attempted filo.
Or baklava.

I really wish that
I had spent more time in the kitchen

with my Greek grandmother.

Let's just be confident
that it's in my DNA.

You thought, you've got two Greeks
in the tent,

they're bound to know
how to make it.

Paul, I think this must be the most
difficult Technical I've ever seen.

Yeah. Baklava.
The hardest part is the lamination.

Above all you've gotta get
that flake.

There's three layers
and then you have the nut layer

and then three layers again.

You've gotta make your dough
and divide it into six.

Three for the bottom,
three for the top.

Then fold it, fold it,
fold it, fold it.

You've gotta do that six times.
Times six.

So, there's a lot of layers
by the time we've finished. Yeah.

If they haven't laminated it, you're
gonna get a solid piece of dough.

You're not gonna get that
beautiful filo pastry. Layered.

Which is what we're gonna be
looking for. OK, let's cut a slice.

Well, that looks beautiful,
thank you.

Who is really gonna come up
trumps in the tent?

I have no idea,
cos this is complicated.

I'm gonna tell myself I can do it,
because I have to,

because otherwise I'm going home -
and I refuse to go home.

First step is for the filo pastry.

Put the dry ingredients into a bowl,
then combine with wet ingredients.

Two eggs, vegetable oil, some butter
and some white wine vinegar.

Full fat Greek yoghurt, as well.

Greek yoghurt.

There you go.

I suppose the yoghurt is in there
because it's a Greek recipe!

Hello. Hey, Matt.
So, have you made baklava before?

I've never made baklava before.
I've never made filo pastry before.

You haven't? It's a massive hassle.
Why would you? Just buy it.

It's a what? A massive...? Hassle.
Oh, "hass". Hassle. Hassle. Hassle.

Oh, my word! I genuinely thought you
said something else there.

A massive hassle. Please don't
write in to complain. Hassle.

Right, let's get my hands in there.

Right, gonna knead the hell
out of this.

I don't want to have too
much gluten in here.

Just enough that it holds together.

And now I'm out of breath.

I think you've invented, like,
a new dance move here. Do you think?

Any other moves? So there's this
one which is kind of. Yeah.

It's called the side shuffle. OK.

And then you've got, like,
the little...

The slam. The slam. Yeah.

I've got a good one, which is...
Go on... the taste.

Where you go like this.

It's underproved.

I'm just doing it
cos other people are doing it!

Don't know what it does.

Right, it's gotta go six
equal balls now.

Dough feels very soft.
It's pretty good.

Roll out the balls of dough to a
square approximately 30 centimetres.

The key part of baklava

is having the layers,
really thin, crispy pastry.

Fold the top and bottom into the
centre creating a rough square.

Take each corner and fold into
the middle. Dust with cornflour.

This is laminating to create
layers in filo.

To create the multi layers of flaky
pastry baklava is famous for...

Corner to corner.

..the bakers must intricately fold
and roll the dough

in a process called lamination.

So I'm taking the edges
to the centre.

Usually you create layers using fat

but in this instance
we're using cornflour.

Hmm, I don't know if this is right.
Like that?

Great, I've gotta do that
six times now.

One, two, three, four.

Folding the edges. Dust.
Now we're talking!

Last one.

Cover and rest,
so I'm covering it and resting it.

I'm measuring out
my pistachio kernels.

The filling needs to provide
that crunchy texture.

I might give them a haircut.

Are you gonna mess this one up like
you did this morning?

I... What? Ohh!

Oh-ee! You're so bloody rude.

Hello, this is the talking cupcake

saying you are halfway
through the challenge.

I glued that there while
you were asleep. Oh, no. Did you?

To assemble, roll the dough
into six 30 centimetre circles,

stack in the tin.

Rolling it back out. Again.

Right that's layer one.

Right, two of six.

This is a bit of a dodgy layer.

Next is the filling.

You want a fair bit of filling -
don't want a stingy baklava, do you?

Now I'm gonna be rolling out
the other three discs.

Cover it up and then proceed
with the next steps.

Don't panic, and follow the recipe.

That's done, everything's done.

Using the diagram provided,
cut the pastry into a star design.

Of course the diagram is smaller.

How are you meant to do this?

There must be an easier way
than this.

Pretty clear, isn't it?

It's actually scaled up.
This one is 20 centimetres wide.

This is 30 centimetres wide.
Oh, he's just showing off.

Do I cut all the way through
or do I just put it on the top?

Who are you talking to?
Are you talking to me? I'm...

You're talking to God!
Noel, do you think I...

Do I cut all the way through it?
Do I cut this all the way through?

I'm gonna cut all the way through.

Go through the worktop into hell
where Paul Hollywood lives.

Me pattern's gone mental.
Don't know what I'm doing any more.

It's hurting my eyes to look at it
so I'm just free styling.

What is that? There's too many
lines for me.

Right, have I done it?
Yeah, I've done it.

Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

Ugh, I'll have to eyeball it, innit?

I don't know how long pastry takes.

40 minutes baking.

This train is due to arrive at the
end of the challenge in 30 minutes.

I think I'm just
going to rotate this.

Bit more butter.

It looks like it's drying out
a little bit.

Just wanna give it a little love.

Oh, come on.

I don't suppose this is one of those

that you can test
with a toothpick, is it?

I think me timer
was set for, like...

Oh, my God.

I didn't put the timer on.

Can't remember how long
it's been in the oven.

How long have we got left?

You have ten minutes left.

It looks done to me.

Ah. What do I do?

I'm gonna go for it now.

I'm taking it out, I'm taking
it out, I'm taking it out.

Agh.

It's a little bit anaemic.

It has pretty much the right colour.

Right, baklava is soaked in syrup.

Syrupy. There we go.

Syrup's gone on. Yum!

Ground pistachios.

So, there's a diamond.

I'm gonna freehand it.

Oh, I'm not sure about this.

The patterns are not
making sense to me.

It's just too much for my mind to
think of a template, to be honest.

Bakers, you have one minute left.

Come on!

It's not coming off.

Ooh.

Last little bit, rose petals.

Shaking like there was no tomorrow.

Come on.

Come on!

Oh, it's so hot.

Almost.

Bakers, your time is up.

That was not pleasant.

That seems really soggy.

Terrified.

Paul and Prue are looking
for seven beautiful baklava

with striking layers of laminated
filo pastry -

but they have no idea
whose is whose.

Shall we start over here,
then, Prue?

The colour's quite nice.

I quite like the colour.
The colour's lovely.

Let's see what it's like.

It's not that bad.

You can see a bit of lamination
there. Yeah. A little bit there.

Mm, really nice -

and if you saw that in a pastry shop
you'd buy a bit, wouldn't you? Mm.

Moving on.

Quite a lot of...
Bit too much pistachio... pistachio.

Little bit too much.
Very clumsy at the edge.

It is - you want it to be
more delicate.

It's sort of, yeah, oh, that'll do.

You can see the lamination
on the top. Yeah.

But you want it a little
darker in colour.

It needed longer in the oven.

Mm, that's lovely flavour.

OK. This is nice and shiny.

I do like the colour of this one.

And the cut is nice.

You have lamination there, see.

Yeah, it's nice and crisp on the
bottom. Mm. The flavour's good.

Moving on. The design's quite
nice on this. Yeah. Neat.

But it's a little undercooked.
It needs longer.

And it's such a pity, cos there's
lots and lots of layers in there.

Yeah, OK.

You can't really see the diamonds.

You've lost all the shape
and all the cut.

It's mess, the top of that's a mess.

This is deliberately to... Mask it.

..to mask the fact that the pattern
has been lost.

The syrup's nice.

There is lamination, it's just
quite doughy. Needed longer.

Moving on.

This is beautiful.
It's a nice design. Very nice.

All the way around.

Yeah, it's got good
lamination there.

It's got a nice colour. Yeah,
it's got good lamination on the top.

Mm, that is lovely crisp,
really good. Mm.

Last. A little bit
higgledy-piggledy, these.

It is a bit all over the place,
innit?

Where are the nuts?

Ah, I had to cut in
to see where they were.

The layers are quite thick.

But the flavour's nice. Delicious.

OK, this is gonna be very
difficult judging.

Paul and Prue will now rank the
baklava from last to first place.

In seventh spot we have this one.

Lizzie, comes down to that little
bit of finesse that you need.

I just haven't got finesse.
You have.

PRUE CHUCKLES

In sixth spot we have this one.

George, just a little bit clumsy.

Amanda is fifth,
Giuseppe fourth, and Chigs is third.

In second place... we have this one.

Oh, my God!

Well, it looks absolutely beautiful.
Well done.

In first we have...

APPLAUSE

Can't believe it!

The diamond pattern
on the top is very good.

You've got a beautiful colour all
the way through. Well done, Jurgen.

Thank you. Smashed it again, mate.
Well done.

What a day. Incredible.

Jurgenator seems to be back!

Oh, my God!

I'm in so much shock -
and do you know what?

I really needed that today.

I've never been up there in
the Technical, so, feels quite wild.

I could've done a lot better
but I had a pretty good Signature -

but I'm not gonna kind of write
myself off just yet.

This rain pretty much symbolises
how my Technical went.

It was a disaster.

Tomorrow I've just got to
do the best I can.

Just one challenge remains
in pastry week.

It's quite wet out there.

The rain is pretty deafening
but we're going to carry on.

Of course. So far,
they're pretty good, actually.

You got Chigs, Giuseppe, you got
Jurgen and you got Crystelle,

you know in the sort of top four
of this week overall.

I think when it comes to the people
that have struggled over

the two challenges, Amanda
and Lizzie, those two...

Where's George, is he in the middle?

I think he's in the middle again,
yeah. A remake of

Malcolm In The Middle over here...
You know what, though?

It's not a bad place to be. But I've
been on Bake Off five years now

and occasionally someone does
something and you almost cry

because it's overwhelmingly good.
You're almost moved. Yes.

Yeah, OK, we want one of those,
guys. We want one of those today.
That's what we're after.

Hello, bakers,
welcome back to the tent.

It's time for your
Showstopper Challenge.

Today the judges would love you
to make an intricate terrine pie.

In the grand old tradition
of French pate en croute,

the judges would like your
showstopping terrine pies

to have an ornate pastry
decoration on the outside.

And to reveal a neat pattern
or design when the pie is cut open.

The fillings and flavours
are up to you.

Noel, what flavours would you use?

I think I'd make a hip-hop
terrine pie.

It'd probably be Flava Flav flavour.

I've just seen Flava Flav's
big clock, actually,

and it seems you've got
four and a half hours

to complete your
Showstopper Challenge.

On your marks. Get set.

♪ Don't believe the hype! ♪

And bake.

The terrine pie originated in France

and is typically packed
with a meat pate.

This is the perfect weather
for a warm pie.

All we need now is a nice glass
of port and a fireplace.

I think this is one of my favourite
challenges because I get to cook.

I'm excited to make it.
I have got thyme on my hands.

We're looking for a highly
decorative terrine.

Now, we're looking for
a decoration on the top

and a beautiful pattern inside.

And I've a little pattern.
Do need finesse today.

The most obvious thing that could go
wrong is they run out of time.

Cos when you bake it, you then need
a decent length of time

to cool it enough to cut it.

This is going to be a very, very
close call

to get it cooled down and set.

Leaking and collapsing
are my biggest fears.

You've got to set everything.

If it's cooler, whatever filling
they've got in will tend to congeal

and solidify and allow that slice
to fall without falling to pieces.

Hi, Jurgen. What are you doing
for your terrine?

Uh, I'm making Lunch in Freiburg.
Freiburg, my hometown,

has a famous dish which it's topside
of beef with horseradish

and sauerkraut. Oh, lovely. Wow, OK.
And all of that goes into my pie.

You can't go wrong with horseradish
and a bit of beef. No.

Jurgen's transforming Freiburg's
famous beef dish

into an ornate pie,

featuring a colourful square
running through the centre

and a border of plaited pastry.

I must say, it sounds absolutely
delicious. Does sound good.

Can you get some German beer ready
for me as well, please?

Ah, unfortunately,
I didn't bring any.

THEY LAUGH

Starting to make my hot water crust.
It's a lot of lard.

No lard before Marbs.

Hot water crust is a go-to pastry
when making savoury pies.

You add hot water into the fat
and flour to gelatinize it.

The addition of hot water
gives the dough elasticity.

There's no danger of it...
I don't really want to say this.

..of it cracking.
But speed is of the essence.

You have to work
with it while it's warm.

So it's kind of race against time.

The faster they work,
the more pliable the pastry.

Need to do this quick enough
to help it stay like Play-Doh

so I don't tear it. And if they can
rush out the rip-free shell...

Fridge... they'll have more time
to work on the filling.

And George isn't wasting any time
cracking on with his.

This is pretty much like
a Christmas dinner in a pie.

We've got sausage meat,
need to roll it bacon,

and then I've got to do...
I've got a lot to do.

We should stop talking. One second.

He's going all out
with his Christmas dinner pie.

The exterior will feature
a decorative pastry print,

the interior a duck
and turkey stuffing

and a giant bacon
and carrot wrapped sausage.

All right, getting there,
getting there.

This is my big massive sausage.

Can't tell what's sausage and what's
hands, to be honest with you.

HE LAUGHS

That's why I love you.
You're out of order.

Amanda's also shaping a sausage.

I do love to make my food with love.

So my sausage is beautifully
presented with bacon,

cherries and pistachios.

She aims to showcase her love
of gourmet food

with a pretty pate pie,

featuring her striking
chicken pate sausage,

a floral decoration and pork pigs.

My sausage is done

so I'm making my little piggies.

There's one.

Lizzie's also aiming
to serve a feast for the eyes.

I am making potato fishes.
It's gonna be unusual.

I want to be the Heston Blumenthal
of the tent.

She hopes to banish the memory
of her messy Technical

with a jaw-dropping Neptune Pie.

The top features a flamboyant
mermaid tail

and the centre,
her novel potato fish.

You're not panicking today?
You seem a bit calmer.

No, I'm a lot calmer today.
Like, I've practised this a couple
of times. It was quite funny

at home. It was like Where's Wally
but with the fish. Everyone was
like, "Have I found the fish yet?"

And I was like, you're just meant
to be able to see it!

THEY LAUGH

Animal designs are proving
a popular choice in the tent.

I've decided to decorate it as
an owl cos it's my wife's
favourite animal.

Um, and she's been incredibly
supportive in all of this.

And she's a much better baker
than I am.

Giuseppe hopes his wife
Laura love both the owl

and the interior which will include
three colourful fillings -

a circle of beef, spinach
and smoked mozzarella.

Lovely finger action you've got.

I know.

Do you think this is good enough for
my wife? Yeah, perfect. Thank you.

Giuseppe might want to wow his wife

but Crystelle's out to impress
her entire family.

Today's bake is dedicated
to my late, great grandmother

called Lila Nana. It's a curry. I
learnt how to make it from my mum.

Do you know what? This is, for me,
I think, my most sentimental bake.

Um, it's a family thing so, for me,

it's just... I really want to do
my family proud with this recipe.

An ode to her late,
great grandmother,

the pie will be shaped to mimic
Lily Nana's Kenyan cottage

and layered with two
of her home recipes -

potato curry and a Goan chicken
pickle curry.

But with a high liquid content,
Crystelle's risking a runny pie.

Getting a curry which is
usually just dumped on a plate

in a rectangular pie was tricky.
Is it going to remain fairly stable?

We don't want to cut in
and it just floods out.

But if it's a really good curry,
as it cools it'll get solid.

It should set slightly.
Exactly that.

Well, good luck,
this sounds amazing. Oh, thank you.

I'd quite like to move in.

Yeah, I would, yeah,
I'd move straight into that.

I hope it turns out OK. Thank you.

Don't want chicken curry
splashing all over you.

Crystelle might be concerned
her curry's too moist...

Oh, BLEEP.

Why's it so stiff?

..but George's giant sausage
is rock hard. Guys.

It's a bit frozen. Put it in
the freezer, I forgot about it.

God, I can't give Prue and Paul
food poisoning.

Bakers, you have three hours left!
You know when I said,
quick, let's do a time call?

I didn't mean let's do a time call
really quickly. But I liked it.

Feeling a bit overwhelmed. I think
I'm going to leave it five minutes.

While George worries about his
sausage, the rest of the bakers

can begin the build.

The last thing you want is
a soggy bottom so I'm using ham.

To stop any liquid.

Stopping a soggy bottom
is just the start.

Paul and Prue are expecting
a beautiful interior...

OK. Potato fishes.

So the fish is going to be, like,
floating in the pattern.

..each slice crammed with
mouthwatering ingredients.

Right, do it for Lily Nana.
Goan cuisine is going in.

Lots of different flavours.

But Chigs has just
one thing on his mind.

Me, I've got some pork
shoulder, pork neck.

This is a pork fest.
Chigs' Leicester Pork Pie.

HE LAUGHS

He's honouring his home county
Leicestershire,

famed for the Melton Mowbray
pork pie.

The centre will be enhanced
with a smattering of colour,

the top a lattice decoration.

Leicestershire is renowned for pork
pies so I hope I do 'em proud.

OK, decoration. This is the fastest
I'm ever going to work.

I'm hoping to bake soon.

I've made chimneys for the steam.
Now crucial moment.

OK. Come on, Crystelle.

Please work.

Trying to figure out how long
to bake cos got to give enough time

to basically cool it down as well.

Now timing is critical.

On top of baking, the bakers must
factor in chilling.

It's all a balancing act because
I want the whole thing fully cooked.

Also I'm going to need a long
cooling time after the baking

because I need to make sure
that the inside is set and
it doesn't collapse.

A good bake will count for nothing
if the pie falls apart.

I've got two hours left.

I need 40 minutes
to whack it in the fridge

so hopefully it'll be done
in 80 minutes.

Oh, fingers crossed.

But George needs more than luck
to fix his time keeping.

The sausage is in but I'm late.

Just rolling decorations on top.

Come on, come on, come on.
Freaking out.

And he isn't the only baker
who's fallen behind.

I've probably spent a bit more time
on decorating than I do normally.

It's my favourite bit, decorating.

I like to make things look nice.

Do you know what? My husband
gets a bit impatient

because I want to decorate 'em.
He just wants to eat the pie.

Just says,
"Get the pie in the oven."

Jesus, now what have I done?

Think I was a bit heavy
with the egg wash.

Don't have time for this.
I need to move now.

Done.

Why is it already leaking?
It hasn't even gone in the oven.

Leaking or not...

Just making all my decoration.
I am worried about the pie, though.

..all the bakers can do now is wait.

Yours is leaking.

Your dough's not leaking.
It is leaking. Can't you smell it?

This is getting stressful.
I should've brought a book.

George, what do you normally do

while you're waiting for something
to bake? What about your dancing?

What dancing? Tell Matt.

Oh, do you do Greek dancing?

No. Amanda.

We'll do it with you. I'm not doing
it. Quick, quick, quick.

Just a bit worried about my pie.
Come on, George.

She's the teacher. She knows it.
Well, go on, what is it? Go on,
then, Amanda. Right, teach Matt.

Left first. So we... Yeah.

THEY HUM

Stop. I'm going to do a wee in a
minute. Flipping heck. It's broke.

It's because I was a bit heavy with
the egg wash and it's just kind of
weighed it down.

George now has a huge decision
to make.

Should I fix the pie?
What the hell do I do?

Shut the door, shut the door,
shut the door, shut the door.

If he leaves his pie in the oven,
the top could fall apart.

But if he takes it out to repair it,
he'll lose vital baking time.

What... to... do.

Right, taking it out.

Feeling out of my depth.

This is pressure, man.
Come on, George.

Come on, man. Come on.

Need some leafage,

cover up the areas
that look messed up.

While George's pie heads back
into the oven, the others...

Come on, come on, come on.
..are coming out.

Go, go, go.

But the wait to unmould
isn't over just yet.

The pies must head to the freezer
to cool down.

Done. Now the filling needs to set
to avoid collapse.

It needs to chill
very, very quickly.

Now I'm nervous.
HE LAUGHS

George and Amanda have
a lot more to worry about.

Mine's got ages. Never going to get
that cool enough to turn out.

They will have no choice
but to unmould molten pies

at risk of a full scale collapse.

Do you know what I wanna do?
I'm going to do this. That's better.

Is that so they can't film it?
No, it's so I can't see it. Oh.

Do you know what? Once I take it out
the tin

I'm sure it'll be a leaking mess
in there.

Quick announcement from
Paul Hollywood in balloon form.

Bakers, you've got half hour left.

Getting it out.

Good god, why is this
so bloody tense?

The cooled pies are finally
ready to unmould.

Let's go, let's go.
Let's get it done.

But for George and Amanda,
the agonising wait continues.

I think I'm going to give it
a little bit longer.
Couple more minutes.

Right, demoulding it.
Hopefully, no soggy bottoms.

And hopefully no collapsing
terrines, either.

Crunch time.

Yes. Phew!

Good. Amazing.

SHE SIGHS Come on.

Oh, no, no, no.

There is a bit of a crack
on the back.

Mine's cracked as well.
There's cracking everywhere.

Oh, look, it's leaked.
That's some serious leakage.

Right, taking it out.

Come on, George. I'm getting it
straight in that freezer.

Amanda, mine's leaking a hell of a
lot. Look. It's fine. What's wrong

with you? It looks perfect.
Yeah, but look at the leak. So?

Bakers, ten minutes left.

Monumental leak there, man.
This needs a bloody dam.

Because the juice is still very hot,
it might just all pour out.

I feel like everybody's waiting
for my pie to fall apart.

How do you get this thing off?
It's still hot. This is dangerous.

Jesus. Leaking.

Soggy bottom.

Praying it's OK.

Fingers crossed.

No pressure.

Oh, it collapsed. Oh, no.

Oh, no. Want a hand, Amanda?

Yes, please. It's gone.

It's come off. Oh!

It's not good.
The pie's stuck on the top.

Oh, mate.
Tell me what you want me to do.

Uh, push that back in.

Just stick the knife under there
so I can get the thing back on.

This is hot, Amanda. Sorry.

Go on, there you go.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

They can fix that. I can't watch.
I know. It's too stressful.

Quick. Don't move it, don't move it,
don't move it, don't move it.
You're going to tear it all up.

Do it slowly. That's it,
that's it, that's it.

Hold fire.

All right, I'm not going to attempt
to take it out of the bottom tray.

Risking the whole thing to collapse.

Do you know what? That's better.

It's all kind of breaking apart,
which is really sad.

Um, but I'm just hoping
if I could just cover all

the cracks I might be safe.
I'm going to lift it.

Ah. Ouch, ouch, ouch.

Slide it underneath. One, two.

Oh. It's collapsing.

Got to get this off.

Oh, no. No, it's proper broken.
Panicking now. It's a mess.

I can't watch.

All right, let's lift it off
the bottom tin. Quick.

Oh, no, no, there's a lip there,
babe, you're going to tear it.
Guys, be careful. I've left mine on.

You've left it on? Yeah. I don't
think it makes any difference now.

Ahhh!

Juice everywhere, isn't there?

Bakers, you have one minute left.

Oh, got a minute.
Repair, repair, repair.

It's like watching
open heart surgery. It is.

Which side shall I put the pigs on?
LAUGHING: This side!

This side, the good side.

Quick, quick, pigs,
pigs, pigs, pigs.

It's gonna hold my pie.

Bakers, your time is up.

Oh. Well done.

Well done for getting it out.
What a disaster.

Sorry, babe. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
It's OK.

I couldn't do anything else.
It's fine, it's not your fault.

I feel your pain, Amanda.
This is messed up.

It's judgement time for
the decorative terrine pies.

Lizzie, would you like to bring up
your Showstopper?

Well, it's certainly
unusual-looking.

It's very bold. I love the design.

I like the fish.
I think the scales look great.

Let's have a look inside, shall we?

Held together nicely and the
fish going through there. Yeah.

Little fish.

You've nearly got that spot on,
Lizzie. I love that.

Your pastry's too thick.
But I quite like the flavour.

I think it's remarkable.

The spinach and the fish,
they're not overcooked

because they've been in there
quite a long time. Thanks.

It's a really perfect owl,
isn't it?

"Ow, don't hurt me."

The design is fantastic.

Good pastry. It's firm enough,
but it's crumblier.

The cheese and all the flavours
blends well with the beef.

It looks very professional.
It's very Giuseppe.

It's excellent, Giuseppe.

I think the pastry,
you've sort of cracked it slightly

handling it out of the tin.
Juice was leaking out of there.

It looks lovely.

You get apricot, you get gherkin.
I think all the flavours work well.

But the design
is pretty uninspiring.

That was a big deal for me,
that was!

I love the vine leaves. Oh, look
at that. I think that's beautiful.

Really beautifully done.

I think the pastry tastes delicious.
But the beef has gone very, very

dry. It is a bit too dry,
but I do think you get away with it,

because you've got the horseradish.
Thank you, Jurgen.

What happened? I should have really
got it in the oven earlier

so it had time to cool down.

But when I took it, the side of it,
one side came away. Ah, right, OK.

It's very good-looking.

It's very pretty.

It's bone-dry. I think
your seasoning is pretty strong,

cos there's so many things going on
in your mouth. And you try to

identify it, but there's just
a mix of a lot of different things.

But I do like the pate. For me,
the pate is the one thing that is

a bit too strong.

Thank you, Amanda.

It's quite dramatic.
I like the two-tone pastry.

But it's underbaked,
and it's collapsed down. Yeah, yeah.

I got it in the oven late,
which was unfortunate.

My tray's under there, Paul.
It was too hot to handle!

Nice interior.

Mm.

Mm!

That sausage meat...

..I question whether it's cooked.
I probed it three times, Paul.

You did? 92 in the centre.
Right, OK.

It is a bit mushy.
It's very mushy, yeah.

It's a pity, because the bacon,
that is delicious.

That's a shame, that,
George. Thank you.

Such a beautiful cottage.

And I love all the little flowers

and the way you've decorated them

and had time to paint them.
Oh, look at that.

Wow! That's SO cool!
The colour layers are lovely.

And you've separated them
with sweet potato. Yeah.

Have you seen this here?

No...

Well done.

That curry, the way you've broken it
down into sections, and each one,

for me - the spice blend, the hot
water crust pastry, the design...

I absolutely agree, Crystelle.
It's brave to make curry pie.

It's witty, it's charming.
And often, things that are witty

and charming are not also
absolutely delicious.

And you've got the pastry perfectly.
Spot-on. Really, really good.

Well done.
Thank you so much!

A handshake on the Showstopper,
that's very rare!

I'm just in so much shock. I was
like, "Something's gone wrong."

And then out came his hand,
and I just died. I literally died.

So maybe I'm a ghost.
Maybe that's why I feel weird.

They complimented the design,
which was good.

So I'm tying to focus
on the positive,

but, yeah, I do feel like I'm in
danger. It is what it is, isn't it?

Someone has to go home,
and if it's my time to go,

then it's my time to go.

We should pay tribute
to these bakers,

because the standard has been
so good this week.

I think, coming into today, we were
talking about Amanda in a little bit

of trouble, we were talking about
Lizzie being in trouble.

But the person who did well
out of this was Lizzie,

because I think she saved herself,
to the detriment of George.

I think George and Amanda
are in a little bit of trouble.

George today, I wasn't happy at all
with that. So, Star Baker is...?

I think Star Baker is
either Giuseppe or Crystelle.

She really smashed it.
You gave her a handshake.

I know. I don't like
giving handshakes.

It hurts you, doesn't it?
It does, yeah!

But I think, ultimately,
that deserved it.

It was a bit of magic, that one.
It was. Very clever.

But I think Giuseppe's done really
well, as well. It looked amazing.

I loved his meat, though.

Are you talking about
Giuseppe's meat? I looked down at it

just as I said it. That's what it
was. We're all friends here. I know.

Well done, bakers, on another week.
It's not easy to find a Star Baker,

but the judges have done it.
This week's Star Baker is...

..Crystelle!
APPLAUSE

Thank you. God!

Oh, that means I've got the horrible
job of announcing the person

who's leaving us. This gets tougher.

It does get tougher every week,
and this has been an amazing week.

But the person who is leaving us
this week is...

..Amanda.

Thank you.

It's OK. I'm all right.

Is it all right? I knew it
cos you kept looking at me.

I mean, you've got to go
sometime, haven't you?

I didn't think when I got here
I'd get that far after seeing all

the other bakers,
but I've had such a good time.

Going to miss you.
You'll be all right, guys.

I'll see you in a few weeks.

Do you know what? I came here
to have a good time.

It's a little bit stressful here,
but it's a kind of fun stress.

Perhaps if I didn't talk so much,
I might have got a bit further.

But I enjoyed it,
so I'm glad I did what I did.

Oh, God!

I mean, that's a shock. My name
was going over and over in my head.

I was preparing myself. I was just
saying, "George. George. George."

And then they called Amanda,
and I could not believe it.

This has given me a big push
to fight for my place.

That pie!

I don't often give out handshakes
in Showstoppers,

but Crystelle deserved it.
It was perfection, in my eyes.

ON PHONE: Hello? Hi. Is everyone
there? Yeah. I got Star Baker!

SHRIEKING ON PHONE

And, guys?

Guys, guys, Paul gave me a handshake
in the Showstopper.

SHRIEKING

Oh, God! And people
wonder why I'm loud!

Next time: It's like a little
science experiment, isn't it?

..caramel week...
Nasty little thing, caramel.

..sees the bakers in sticky
situations with the Signature...

This isn't right... take on
a ten-fingered Technical...

Paul is demanding perfection.

..and struggle with an architectural
sugar Showstopper.

There's a crack. Who will
make it to the quarterfinal?

Hands up who's having
a heart attack.

And who... Where's me balls?
..will come unstuck?

Group heart attacks, everyone?

I'm so excited. It's caramel week.

So too am I, Noel Fielding.

And actually, here's a fun fact
about caramel week.

Did you know that leathery screen star

Mel Gibson's original name
was Caramel Gibson?

[chuckles] I did know that, actually.
The Lethal Weapon films are my favourite.

Particularly love the powerful acting
of Danny Oven-Glover.

[laughs]

-You ruined it.
-What?

I had a lovely joke there
about caramel week.

All the boys and girls
who watch this show



would really enjoy that joke,
and you've absolutely ruined it.

[scoffs] I don't know
what his problem is, Danny.

Fancy introducing the show with me?

Okay.

Welcome to the Great British Baking Show.

[Matt] This time
the bakers must conquer caramelâ¦

Carmel is a very fussy baby.

â¦with a super sweet Signatureâ¦

[Chigs] Flippin' hate caramel.

â¦an even stickier Technicalâ¦

-Why does this happen to me?
-You're here for the money shot.

â¦and one of the most
demanding Showstoppersâ¦

No, no.

â¦of all time.



-Yeah, I can't.
-Flippin' nightmare.

[opening theme music playing]

Caramel week, the week
where anything can go wrong. [laughs]

[unenthusiastically] Yayâ¦
Proper fake "Yay," that, isn't it?

[Lizzie] It's completely different
to every other week we've done.

-It's terrifying.
-[JÃ¼rgen] Caramel is heated sugar

that solidifies without crystallizing.

I'm dreading it. [laughs]

It's just sugar
and then suddenly, bam, it's caramel.

Then it burns, and you're like,
"My life's over."

Dare I say it,
I'm feeling fairly confident.

Bakers, welcome back
to the tent for caramel week.

[Noel] Today,
for your Signature challenge,

the judges would love you
to make a highly decorative,

sharing-sized caramel tart.

Now you can create
any style of tart you like,

with any flavours or additional elements.

But remember,
caramel must be the star of the show.

Oh, not again.

Years ago,
I auditioned for a part in The Bill,

lost out to an Italian meringue.

-What was the role?
-It was an Italian meringue.

I can kind of see it from both sides.

-You have two and a half hours.
-[Matt] On your marksâ¦

-[Noel, sing-song] Get setâ¦
-Bake!

It's a caramel tart,
and it's a highly decorative caramel tart

and one you've got to
put your own spin on.

-And not a lot of time to do it.
-It's caramel, innit?

You need to be patient.
'Cause when you rush it, things mess up.

And I don't wanna go home.

I can't be trusted with molten sugar.
It's just a terrifying week.

[Paul] What we're looking for

is a beautiful, thin base,
a beautifully set caramel,

flavours which enhance the caramel
with a gorgeous decoration on top.

Caramel has to be the star.

We don't want so much
that it's overbearingly sweet.

It mustn't be rock-hard, like a toffee.

And it mustn't be runny like a sauce.

[Crystelle] I'm just trying
to get my pastry done.

Get that chilled and then I can
focus on all the fillings and stuff.

It's so important that they get
the caramel base cold

before they decorate it.

If they don't cool, if you put anything
on the top, it will just melt.

[Prue] I think the bakers
will be nervous about caramel week.

They won't have worked
that much with it.

It's pure sugar.

It's not something you'd eat every day.

-Morning, George.
-Hello.

Morning. Hello.

What have you decided
to do for caramel tart?

A bit like a banoffee pie.

I've got a chocolate tart
and a caramel custard,

my bananas, and then I got a toffee sauce.

And then I'm going to try
and cut through all that sweetness

with double cream and crÃ¨me fraiche.

I love the way you went, "Use double cream
to cut through the sweetness."

[Matt] George's classic flavour combos

will reside
in a chocolate short pastry case,

and rest on a caramel custard
he'll bake inside the tart.

Getting it done and cooled on time -
is that gonna be all right?

The fridge is my friend
in this challenge.

-Pray my custard doesn't curdle.
-Well, yeah.

[Noel] Lizzie is also risking
cramming in a custard.

It's a caramel custard
and then caramelised pineapple.

[Noel] And is hoping this bake
won't sink her chances

of getting to next week's quarter final.

My caramel tart
is called "My Tart Will Go On."

[all chuckle]

-[Lizzie] Funny, aren't I?
-And are you a big CÃ©line Dion fan?

Who isn't?

[Noel] Lizzie's Titanic-inspired tart

will be topped with caramelised pineapple,
caramel shards and Chantilly cream.

And will also be filled
with a baked caramel custard.

During practice,
did you get everything cool enough

to be able to build those layers?

-[sighs] No.
-[Paul] No.

-Why are you carrying on then?
-We're just having a panic, aren't we?

[all chuckle]

I've made my pastry and that's going
in the freezer for 15 minutes.

Shortcrust pastry,
so cold butter is the key.

So when I roll it out,
it doesn't start shrinkin'.

[Matt] With pastry chillingâ¦

One task done. Whoo-hoo!

â¦the bakers can concentrate

on the flavours
to complement their caramel.

I am doing an apple pecan
and miso caramel tart.

I want to taste the cinnamon apples.

But no sugar's going in because I really
don't want this to be sickly sweet.

[Matt] Crystelle's tart
will have a layer of pecan nutty crunch,

miso-flavoured caramel
and apple chunks cooked with cinnamon.

So, it's relatively heathy.

Sugar-free apples
and lots of caramel sauce. [chuckles]

[chuckles]

[Lizzie] Probably start
caramelising me pineapples.

[Noel] Flavour isn't all
the bakers must perfect.

I feel like a chef when I do that.

[Noel] They must
also conjure up textures

that balance luscious caramel softness.

There will be a crunch
with roasted hazelnuts,

both chunks and small bites.

[Noel] Giuseppe's nut-packed caramel tart

will come topped
with yet more caramelised nuts

in a sweet apricot cremeux.

[Noel] How's caramel for you?

It doesn't like moisture,
it doesn't like too hot, or too cold.

Temperamental.

I'm used to dealing
with an Italian wife, so--

[laughs]

You know this is going on telly.

-[Noel laughing]
-Whoops.

[chuckles]

[Noel] Giuseppe isn't the only baker
going a bit nutty.

I'm using three different kinds of nuts,

but the richness of the caramel
covers most of the nut flavours.

[Noel] JÃ¼rgen will pack pecans,

walnuts and pistachios
into a caramel layer

he'll bake inside his pastry case
and top with a kumquat crÃ¨me chiboust.

Now we're talkin'.
I love a bit of kumquat.

-Would you mind passing the cream, please?
-[Noel] Yes, of course, the cream.

I feel like now I've passed you the cream,
this is now our bake.

-This is our bake.
-[chuckles]

Just remember, if you hold that trophy up,
it's part mine.

-Yeah.
-Pastry time.

So, bring it out, roll it out, bake it,

and then, yeah,
Bob's your uncle. [chuckles]

I want to roll it very, very thin,
about two millimetres thick

to make it very, very crisp.

[Chigs] Need to make sure
I get all the grooves in the tart,

get a nice finish.

They'll look out for the little details.

[Matt] Aiming for a finish with finesse,

Chigs will top his tart
with fine sugar work.

He's going big on flavour,
covering a ginger-laced caramel

with a rich chocolate ganache.

The chocolate was overpowering
when I was practising,

but I've changed it now,

I'm increasing the amount
of caramel in there.

"Blind-bake for 20 minutes."

Where's my balls?

[Matt] Baking the pastry case
before the filling is addedâ¦

Going in, then.

â¦helps avoid
the dreaded soggy bottom.

This will go in
for 18 minutes to start with.

I'll take off the baking beans
and then in for 15.

Be good to me, please.

[exaggerated]
Right, bakers, the Union have convened

and voted
that you are halfway through the task.

Anybody have any questions,

please direct them to the foreman.

[chuckles]

[Chigs] Start making the caramel.

[Noel] The bakers must
now turn their attention

to the star of the show.

It's fine to eat out of a jar,
but when you have to make it,

it's a nasty little thing,
caramel. [laughs]

Just wanna make sure the water
is mixed in with the sugar.

[Noel] Whichever method
the bakers chooseâ¦

I'm doing a wet caramel.

I think dry caramel's the easiest.
It's just sugar. A kid's dream.

â¦they must be
incredibly preciseâ¦

-Caramel is a very fussy baby.
-â¦about temperature.

Gotta wait for that to get to 117
to get to caramel stage.

I kind of sound like
I know what I'm talking about.

[Noel] As creating the perfect colourâ¦

I judge the correct browning by eyesight.

â¦is the only way
to obtain the distinctive flavour.

[Giuseppe] The trick with this,

is to take it out
when it's lightly golden.

Because it'll keep cooking.

[Noel] Judging the exact moment
to turn off the heat is critical.

So, this is looking amber, and
amber means, "Get ready to rumble

'cause caramel's coming." [chuckles]

[Noel] Take things too farâ¦

Literally, could be seconds.

â¦and the caramel will be bitter.

[Crystelle] You can really
taste a burnt caramel.

[Chigs] Worried my caramel's
gone too dark.

Let's just see what happens.
I don't want to do it again.

[JÃ¼rgen] I think we are pretty close.
I'll add the cream.

I'm going in.

[Crystelle] It's high fat, high sugar.
Oh, yeah.

[laughs]

[Noel] That caramel looks delish.

It has gone a bit dark.

Paul will match it
to the back of his hand.

-[both chuckle]
-It's the perfect colour.

-Perfect tan.
-That's how he tans himself with caramel.

[both laugh]

The wasps love him.

[Matt] With plenty of butter addedâ¦

Would you like to go for a swim in that?

â¦it's now the baker's
flavours that come into play.

The smell of the hazelnuts
is just phenomenal. I love it.

[Crystelle] This is miso paste.

It's like a fermented bean paste.

âª Yummy, yummy âª

Caramel custard, done.

Ready to go.

Right, let's get this tart out.

[JÃ¼rgen] It's very puffed up, but I think
it's just the top layer of the pastry.

[Matt] Now the bakers
split into two different camps.

[Crystelle] Yum, yum, yum.

[Matt] Crystelle, Giuseppe and Chigs
are ready to layer and chill their tarts.

Look at this.

This is a moment, a key moment.

This is my nemesis.

-Evil Caramel.
-Evil Caramel.

Wasn't there a villain
in The Smurfs called Caramel?

[Matt] But Lizzie, George
and JÃ¼rgen still have elements

to bake inside their pastry cases.

[JÃ¼rgen] The caramel needs
to bake for half an hour

so I need to get the tart
in as quickly as possible.

We're baking the custard
in the tart for 40 minutes,

which will leave me 20 minutes
to finish off and cool.

Which is a bit worrying.

[Crystelle] These are my
little decorations.

[Noel] While some
have time to finesseâ¦

I've never seen a man
cut liquid with scissors before.

There you go. There's always a first.

â¦JÃ¼rgen, Lizzie and George
must juggle getting their tarts bakedâ¦

[George] The custard
shouldn't be rock hard,

it needs to have a bit of wobble.

â¦while still allowing
enough time to cool.

Then it's got to set.

[Noel] But there's a big worry

when it comes to baking
egg custard in a hurry.

I hope it hasn't curdled.

[Noel] The wrong oven temperatureâ¦

Dropped the oven from 180 to 120.

â¦risks the egg protein curdling
and ruining the desired silky texture.

[Lizzie] Should've just done
the set custard.

How much time do we have left?

Bakers, you have 11 onions,
some butter and six loo rolls.

-Is that your shopping list?
-Oh, sorry.

Bakers, you have half an hour.

-What do you think of this jiggle?
-Coming out now.

-Yeah, that looks good.
-[Lizzie] Goin' out.

[Crystelle] Come on, hon,
you're gonna do it.

[George] It needs to cool.

It's probably 120, 130 degrees.

Everything now depends
on getting things cooled in time.

[Matt] With half of the tent's tarts
only just going in to chillâ¦

Oh, my God.

-â¦the other group of bakersâ¦
-[Chigs] It's set now.

â¦are one step ahead.

[Crystelle] I'm just doing stars
in different sizes and shapes.

How come she's piping already?

The cake is still in the freezer.

[George] If it doesn't cool in time,

the double cream's just
gonna melt like a puddle on top.

Bakers, you only have
five minutes remaining.

[George] Still hot.

Well, you have to bite the bullet.

It looks wonderful.
It is still quite warm.

[George] Bloody curdled.

It's never looked like this.

I can tell it's curdled.

[Lizzie] The cream is melting.

It is still quite hot.

[George] Come on,
this must have cooled down by now.

Bakers, you have one minute left.

[Lizzie] Oops. It's a lake of cream.

I think this was a bad idea.

[Chigs] Come on. There you go.

I just wanted it to be simple,
but effective.

Don't tell anyone,
this is our little secret.

I don't even know
if I've got enough cream left.

Come on.

[Noel] Bakers, your time is up.

Please place your caramel tart
at the end of your work station

and chill.

What, they should chill
or they should chill the tart?

Either. [laughs]

[George] I've got curdled custard,
melted cream.

[Lizzie] This is finesse.
Paul, eat your heart out. [chuckles]

Look, this is all nice and smooth.
Why did it curdle?

[Matt] The bakers'
sharing caramel tarts

will now face the judgment
of Paul and Prue.

-Hello, Lizzie.
-Hello!

Hey, Lizzie.

This is "My Tart Will Go On."

Erm, like Titanic,
it was a disaster movie.

The cream melted.

-[laughs]
-[Prue] It does look rough and ready.

It's the piping that you've lost.
Probably with the heat from underneath it.

-That's one crispy base.
-[cracking]

Mmm.

Well, you might not
have managed the finesse.

Flavour is delicious.
And it's definitely a caramel tart.

I think if you could have just had time

to finish it properly,
you'd have a little triumph here.

Thanks for the lifeboat anyway.

I'll throw a life jacket as well.

The caramel
is absolutely delicious with that base.

It's a shame it looks like that.

Still, I love it. Finesse, it's not.

I like the look of it.
The pipework's good.

And the sides look neat.
Good colour as well.

-So far, so good.
-[sighs] Good God.

[Prue] Mmm.

Quite treacly. The caramel.
So, it's slightly bitter.

But having said that,
because you've got the apple

and the nuts and the cream,
it balances it out.

-[Prue] I think it's lovely.
-[Paul] Good job.

-Looks lovely.
-It's very neat.

[Paul] Yeah,
it's good decoration on top of that.

[Prue] Thank you.

-Chigs, it's too strong for me.
-[Paul] Yeah.

Too heavy on the chocolate,
almost too much caramel.

-I know it's a caramel tart.
-[Chigs] Right.

-The caramel is too dark.
-[Chigs] Okay.

The ginger is coming through,
it's delicate,

the pastry's a little bit thick.

I think you've taken
the caramel a little too far.

Oh, fair enough.

[Paul] It's beautiful, very thin.
And I love the hazelnuts.

[Prue] That pastry is so crisp.
The caramel is a little liquid.

Funnily enough, though it's quite liquid,
the textures are wonderful.

-I think it's overall a little too sweet.
-Right.

We wanted caramel to be the hero flavour.
It's not. It's the hazelnut.

Okay.

There have been issues with cooling.

It's a pity, because we did ask
for a beautifully decorated tart.

Obviously, the first thing
you see about that is the split.

[Paul chuckles]

It's gonna rip
every tooth that was in my head.

What you made is nut toffee.

-It's too chewy.
-[Prue] Not your best, JÃ¼rgen.

-Great flavour.
-Thank you.

But not quite what we asked for.

Looks like global warming in the Arctic.

-[George] Cooling time didn't work out.
-[Prue chuckles]

That is very nice thin crust.

Custard looks
as if it's just curdled a little bit.

[Paul] The custard's definitely curdled,
and that caramel,

'cause it's on the warm custard,
it just remains liquid.

Not getting a huge amount of flavour,
which is annoying.

The glory of caramel custard
is the smoothness.

Once you curdle it, you've lost
the thing that it's famous for.

-I like the base.
-It's all about the base.

[Prue chuckles]

-[Paul] Thank you.
-Thanks very much.

-I like it all. And I like you.
-Thanks, that means a lot.

[George] I knew the custard was curdled.
I could see it.

Couldn't really get the flavours as well.
So, not a good morning at all.

-[indistinct chattering]
-[Lizzie] No finesse, again.

Flavour, no finesse.

There is no doubt that the judges
have stepped up a gear.

It's a sign
that the competition is getting serious.

[thunder rumbling]

[Noel] The bakers were able
to practise their caramel tarts,

but have no idea what caramel conundrum
awaits them in the Technical Challenge.

Hello, bakers.

Today your Technical Challenge
has been set for you by Paul.

Paul, any words of advice?

[Paul] You'll recognise this recipe,
and it's pretty straightforward.

So, we expect perfection and not excuses.

Okay, as ever, the Technical Challenge
will be judged blind.

We're gonna have to ask
these two to skip out of the tent.

Off you pop.

They're actually going
bra shopping for Paul.

-That's nice they can do that together.
-It's nice, isn't it?

For your Technical Challenge today,
Paul would love you to make ten identical

caramel biscuit bars.

Each biscuit bar should consist
of a crumbly, buttery shortbread finger

topped with thick caramel
and coated with chocolate.

You have an hour and a half.
Doesn't sound long enough.

-On your marksâ¦
-Get setâ¦

Bake!

[Giuseppe] The recipe looks sparse.
This is all we have.

That's it.

I think we all know
what this is, secretly.

It's a family favourite,
but I don't do well with those.

I've never attempted
to make the recipe.

The shop-bought thing
is perfect as it can be.

[chuckling] So what's the use of it?

We're looking for ten identical
chocolate caramel shortbread biscuits.

You've got shortbread caramel on the top

-and you cover it in chocolate.
-Perfect.

Making a shortbread,
the clue is in the name: short.

So you've got to add everything together,
but not overmix it.

If you fold it that extra bit,
it goes like rubber.

The caramel has to be just on the top.
Not going down the sides.

[Paul] Traditionally, it's on top.

You've got to allow the caramel
to set to a point.

You go too high,

-it'll set like toffee.
-[Prue] Toffee.

[Paul] If you do too less,
it will just run off.

-Mmm.
-[Paul] It's delicious.

The caramel is soft but not hard.

It's got a bit of substance to it.

-Have you ever tried it in tea?
-[Prue] Not with chocolate on it.

Mmm.

The first line is,
"Make the shortbread dough."

That's it.

So I've got the caster sugar, butter.
I'm gonna put my egg in.

I'm just mixing my flour in by hand.

You want the shortbread
to be snappy, buttery and crumbly.

You get better control
if you do it by hand.

[exclaims] Right. Come on!

Do you eat biscuits
like the one you're making?

Sometimes. Yeah. If I want, like,
a sugary pick-me-up.

A sugary pick-me-up
would be a good slogan for this.

Should we do an advert?

When you want a sugary pick-me-up,

[hesitating] have one of these shortbread

crumbly fingers. With caramel
on top and chocolate coating

that we can't name,
but you know what they are.

You see them in shops
in golden wrappers.

[chuckling]

[JÃ¼rgen] That's should be good.

"Roll the dough into a rectangle
and place in the loaf tin."

The thickness of the dough
should be pretty consistent.

[Lizzie] It's a bit sticky actually.

If I just press it in
to make the tin shape.

And now, we're gonna put me dough
in the freezer to chill.

-[timer beeping]
-Gonna put it in for five minutes.

Let's see what happens.

We're just gonna sum up the bakers
in a very concise way.

Check this out.

Al Pacino, if he was on
the Guess Who? board.

-Lumberjack Robert De Niro serial killer.
-Wow. [chuckling]

The main puppet in the Labyrinth.

Mixed with League of Gentlemen.

Princess Leia, dressed as
a children's bullfighter.

-[chuckles]
-Wow!

Never come here again.

-[Noel laughs]
-That's it.

-[Noel] That's it. My work's done.
-[laughs]

[Noel] They all hate me now.

[Lizzie] That's chilled
for about 15 minutes.

Next step is bake.

I'm going in.
So I'll check after 15 minutes.

Right. I'm going to set it
for ten minutes, initially.

Twelve minutes to start off with.

[sighs]

[Noel] Hi, Giuseppe.
Me and Matt are a bit overworked.

-We're a bit tired today soâ¦
-Aww!

Maybe you could do the time?

-Can you do it in Italian?
-Yeah, which one?

That we're halfway through.

[speaking Italian]

[laughing]

I'm gonna move on, I think.
Make the caramel.

The dreaded caramel.

The hard stuff.

I'm looking for amber, but not too dark.

Not happy with that colour.

We're getting there.
I want it to be a full-bodied caramel.

Like a nice glass
of red wine. [laughs]

Now, what I'm gonna do is add the cream.

I'm gonna start doing some funny business,
fog up me glasses.

Thinking to add the butter now.
It needs to get harder.

[Crystelle] Lovely.
I'm going to take that off.

If it's too hot,
it then turns into toffee

and Paul's teeth will fall out
when he eats it.

[George] Just a bit worried
about my caramel.

Don't know if I've done the right thing.

[Chigs] Just checking it.

No, a couple more minutes. [grunts]

Two more minutes.
I don't want undercooked biscuits.

[timer beeping]

Think this is ready now.
It's getting a nice

golden colour.

This is definitely the colour
of shortbread.

[JÃ¼rgen] That should be it.

Starting to get a bit darker at the edges.

That looks good.

Just want it
to cool down a little so I can cut it.

[Giuseppe] If they want perfection,
they should be exactly the same size.

Which is not gonna be easy
'cause this is 18 centimetres.

So I have to cut them at
one point eight centimetres each.

I hope that just broke
in the right place.

[Giuseppe] One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

That did not break
in the right place. [sighs heavily]

Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

I'm gonna have to just try
and pipe the caramel.

The caramel needs to be
liquid enough to be pipeable,

but stiff enough to stay up.

Just about the right consistency.

[George] Mine won't come through.

It's not pipeable.
I'm gonna try and soften it up again.

[Giuseppe] Oh, this is definitely
of pipeable consistency.

[Lizzie] No finesse again.
Just got to roll with it.

[George] Let's see if that works.

[Crystelle] I'm running out of caramel.

Oh, oh, just one more. One more push.

-Sounds like I'm a midwife. [laughing]
-[Noel] Yes.

It's hot.
No, why does this happen to me?

[sighs wearily]

This is a flipping nightmare.

Nightâ¦mare.

I would start melting the chocolate now.

I'm thinking about
how to do the coating.

I thought of dipping.

But the caramel layer
is too delicate for pour it over.

Mmm. Is it just the top that needs
to be coated? I don't know.

Bakers, you have five minutes left.

[Crystelle] Stress, stress, stress.

[Giuseppe] This is gonna get messy.

-Phew.
-[Chigs] I'm just gonna pour on top now.

[Crystelle] I feel
like it's all gonna just fall off.

[George] Awful challenge.

[Giuseppe] It's dripping everywhere.

Well, these are gonna be
the worst home-baked biscuits.

They're not even.

[George] We've lost some biscuit
in this one.

[gasps] I hate these.

Bakers, you have one minute left.

[screams]

Right, cardigan is coming off.

There needs to be a zig-zag, right?
I'm panicking.

-You can do this, kids.
-Can we really?

-[Lizzie] Not gonna get perfection again.
-[gasps]

Plating up.

Oh, oh, oh.

Oh, this caramel
has fallen off my biscuit.

Put that one at the end.

Bakers, your time is up.

[George] I'm screwed.

[Matt] Paul and Prue are expecting
ten identical shortbread biscuit fingers,

topped with caramel
and coated in chocolate.

And they have no idea
whose bake is whose.

We'll start with these.

They are quite neat
and they're all pretty uniform.

There's a little pattern
across the top.

-Nice and slim. I quite like it.
-[Paul] Yeah.

[Prue] The caramel is lovely.
But I think the biscuit is a little soggy.

But it's neat enough.
And the flavour's there.

Last-minute rush job. They're a mess.

[Prue] There's too much chocolate
in the middle, and not enough at the end.

[Paul] Biscuit's a bit soggy again.
Caramel's dropped down on one side.

[Prue] We wanted the caramel
just on the top.

[Paul] The flavour's there.

-[Prue] Right.
-[Paul] Moving on to this mess.

[Prue] This one is not finished at all.

Watch yourself, Prue.

[grunts]

That'll take your teeth out.

-[Paul chuckling]
-[Prue chuckling] So hard!

[Paul] That's basically toffee.

-Not a biscuit.
-Textures are all wrong.

Moving on.

-A bit messy.
-[Prue] Doesn't look great, does it?

[Paul] It cut quite well.

Very soft again.

-[Prue] It's too soft.
-[Paul] The flavours are good.

These are pretty uniform.
They have a pattern.

-Wow, there you go.
-[Prue] Mmm.

-That's quite a good biscuit.
-[Paul] Hmm. Got a nice caramel.

They got all the elements,
but it's just not neat.

Right. Okay.

[Prue chuckles]

-Good luck.
-[Paul] Ah, there's one.

-Soft biscuit.
-It's going to be a very soft biscuit.

[Paul] Caramel all around the edges.

It's gone quite rubbery, that biscuit.
And they look a bit of a mess.

Although there are some
decoration on the top.

Okay.

[Noel] Paul and Prue will now
rank the caramel fingers

from worst to best.

In sixth place

is this one. George.

You took your caramel
to a brick-hard toffee,

and you didn't really finish.

In fifth spot, we have this one. Lizzie.

Bit of a mess.

-And the shortbread was like bubble gum.
-Oh, yeah.

[Noel] Crystelle is fourth,
and Chigs is third.

And in second placeâ¦

And we have this one.
Who's that? JÃ¼rgen? That was you.

They look very good.
And the biscuit's nice.

Just not perfect.

-So in first place.
-[Crystelle] Yay.

-I wouldn't clap.
-[all laughing]

[Paul] Erm, the overall look
was pretty good.

The biscuit is a bit soft,
but overall, yours ticked the most boxes.

-I'll take that.
-Yeah, well done.

That was another surprise.

Certainly, getting first is a boost.

However, Paul did say,
"I wouldn't clap." [laughs]

They looked a bit uneven
and that got me second place.

But I'm happy with that.
It feels better than this morning.

I don't think
that could have gone any worse.

I've had a terrible day.

I just want to produce
a good Showstopper,

and just show that I can produce
something that's not toffee.

Gonna do my best.

[Matt] The bakers now have
one more caramel challengeâ¦

-[Crystelle] Good luck.
-Good luck, everyone.

â¦in which to impress the judges.

Hello, bakers. Welcome back to the tent.
It's time for your Showstopper challenge.

The judges would like you to create

a visually spectacular
caramel-flavoured dessert,

complete with an exquisite
sugar-work dome or sphere.

[Noel] The style of dessert
is entirely up to you,

but it must have at least one baked
element and two caramel components.

You have four and a half hours.

Enough time to attract every donkey,
fly and wasp in the vicinity.

-[Matt] On your marksâ¦
-[Noel] Get setâ¦

Bake!

Here we go. Here we go.

The sugar dome is going to be
the headache of the whole thing.

Head down, happy thoughts, good vibes.

Highly decorated Showstoppers
for me are the best thing,

and the fact
that it's married up with caramel,

this should taste and look amazing.

Just to make it more difficult,
we've asked them to encase the whole thing

in a dome of sugar.

Who would ever, in their spare time,
make a sugar dome?

It's a specialist skill which you don't
really expect most bakers to have.

But of course, these are great bakers.

We do expect them
to be able to work with sugar.

Sticky, sticky.

Traditionally, it'd be made
with caramelised sugar,

but they can use isomalt
which is actually more stable.

[Prue] The most important thing
is you should be able to see through it.

Thinner and the clearer, the better.

I'm not expecting failures.

Like hell I'm not.

-[Paul] Hi, Chigs.
-Hi, Paul. Hi, Prue.

What are you doing
for your caramel dessert?

Mine is called "The Caramel Mistake,"
because every time I made it,

-I can't stop making mistakes.
-Right, okay. Good start.

So, my sugar dome, I went through
two kilos of sugar at home

-and I couldn't get one out.
-How many times did you do it?

I think it was sixteen times in total.

And then I learned
about this lovely stuff.

-[Noel] Is that isomalt?
-It's isomalt, worked first time.

[Noel] Chigs' dome will showcase
a chocolate flower,

his layered dessert contrasts

caramel, chocolate and pecan
with a coffee mascarpone mousse.

The first time I did it,
it didn't set properly.

I added an extra sheet of gelatin

to make sure it sets.

-You started last year?
-Yeah.

-So you're learning on the job?
-[Chigs] Yeah, like an apprenticeship.

-[Paul] Well, good luck, Chigs.
-Thank you, guys.

[Matt] But when it comes to sugar domesâ¦

I'm so scared. [chuckles]

â¦there's more than one novice
in the tent.

I've broken more domes than I've made,
let's put it like this.

In practice, it has turned out very hazy.

I've got a couple of tricks
to make it more transparent.

I'm not sure if they will work.
I'll do my best.

[Matt] Rich with caramel,

Giuseppe's layered dessert
includes a set salted caramel mousse

topped with a set apricot
and caramel glaze.

That is really lovely flavours.

-And they're pretty classic.
-And lots of caramel.

I've made sure that caramel
is everywhere in my dessert today,

so there will be no complaints.

So this is my peanut sablÃ© base.
That's going in for 15 minutes.

[Noel] The bakers can choose
any style of dessert they wish.

It's a dessert that looks
like a Russian charlotte.

So I've got lady fingers on the outside.

I am making an apple cake
with Calvados in.

Be boring
if we all done the same, wouldn't it?

[Noel] But they must deliver
contrasting layers

of set and baked elements.

[JÃ¼rgen] Needs to be a harmony
of textures and flavours.

Every element needs
to generate an interest, a curiosity.

[Noel] One baker
going all out on layersâ¦

[JÃ¼rgen] There's 107 steps on my list.
Quite busy today.

â¦is JÃ¼rgen.

One element is a caramel.
Another element is a hazelnut praline.

And then I've got a caramel bavarois.

I've got a shortcrust bottom.

Then I've got a layer of mango
and passionfruit, er, bavarois,

then a chocolate genoise,

then a caramel bavarois
and passionfruit glaze on top.

Under the dome is a mango flower.

I've got lady fingers on the outside.

-Goodness.
-Is that it?

-Is that all?
-I probably could bake a few more things.

-No, no, no, don't.
-[all laughing]

[Noel] Encased in lady fingers
and topped with a mango flower,

JÃ¼rgen's ambitious
caramel and fruit charlotte

will be packed
with multiple layers of flavour.

Is this going to be your return to form?

I'll try to make it my return
to form, yes.

When you don't have an excellent week,
you still have quite a good week,

but then everyone's disappointed,
like you have to be the best every week.

Even if you get one element wrong,
everyone's like, "JÃ¼rgen!"

[JÃ¼rgen] I want to do my best.

[Matt] JÃ¼rgen may be stacking up
a wide variety of layersâ¦

Making element number three:
chocolate genoise.

â¦but George is taking a simpler approach
with layers of nutty meringue.

Scaled it back a little bit.

So the main component is a dacquoise,
so I can have three of them.

Think I want crispy exterior
with a little chew inside.

Otherwise, it's just a bit of
a chewy mess in your mouth.

[Matt] Between his trio of hazelnut
and almond dacquoise layers,

George is opting for a salted caramel
Italian meringue buttercream

and a smooth chocolate ganache.

The dacquoise itself,
are they gonna be difficult

to break through three layers of it?

In practice,
it seems to have gone pretty well.

-You need to bring your A game today.
-I know. I packed my bags last night.

-[all laughing]
-There's confidence for ya!

I'm going to go and unpack your bags now.

-Thanks, Noel.
-Good luck, George.

Cheers.

Once the caramel layers are done,
I'll feel a lot more calmer,

'cause they are supposed
to be the main element.

[Noel] As if making caramel
wasn't tough enoughâ¦

This will be caramel. I hope.

â¦today, the judges
want this sticky star ingredient

showcased in spectacular style.

This is going to go in a mousse
and then by swirling in some caramel,

you'll kind of see
different shades of caramel.

"Fifty Shades of Caramel"
is what I'm calling it.

[Matt] It's a challenge that means
taking on multiple tricky techniques.

-What are you doing?
-This is the early stages of honeycomb.

-Oh, I like honeycomb.
-Do you?

Yeah. The only comb we need.

So that's gonna be honeycomb.
Sugar and syrup,

and then bring it up to about 150
before you add the bicarb.

It's like a little science
experiment, isn't it?

[Noel] And Lizzie is playing mad professor
in more ways than one.

Unlike everyone else, I'm not going
for the delicate dome on top.

That's just not me.

So, er, I'm doing a bowl
and then I'm filling everything inside.

[Paul] This sounds like a trifle.

-It's a hodgepodge of desserts.
-It is, yeah.

It's called
"Roses Really Smell Like Caramel."

-And people get flowers all the time.
-[all chuckle]

-And I'd rather get cake.
-[Prue chuckling]

[Matt] Liz is turning the bake
on its head with a blue isomalt bowl

filled with apple cake
and sage-flavoured caramel

and decorated with apple
and toffee pastry roses.

-I want to see finesse.
-You say this every week.

-[all laughing]
-And you are getting better.

-I want to see the finished product today.
-Proper finesse.

[Matt] Whilst Lizzie needs to refine
her floral decorationsâ¦

Look at the way I dress.
Does it look like I have finesse

in any aspect of my life? [chuckles]

â¦Crystelle is working on a prickly plant
that's close to her heart.

[Crystelle] My late granddad, Greg,

the day before
he suddenly passed away,

he randomly bought a cactus
and he left in the porch of our house,

and then he passed away,
sadly, the following day.

But that cactus is still in our house,
and it is humongous.

So, I'm calling it "Granddad Greg's
Cactus Garden."

[Matt] Crystelle's
salted caramel mousse dessert

will contain a coffee peanut ganache
on a peanut biscuit base,

whilst Grandad Greg's cacti

will sit underneath
an isomalt terrarium dome.

He was very, very generous and just
buy us slabs of chocolates and sweets.

My mum would get so annoyed.

This is for him,
let's hope I don't mess it up. [chuckles]

[Noel chuckling] You didn't believe me
when I said I've unpacked for you.

You're not going anywhere, mate.

You really got my clothes?
You are the best.

I had a right rummage-around in your room.

-[both chuckle]
-That is hilarious.

-George, I'm wearing your pants.
-[George] I love it.

-How long have we got left?
-Bakers, you are--

Noel, you are halfway through
telling the bakers

-they are halfway through.
-[Noel] You're halfway through.

Noel, you have told the Bakers
they were halfway through.

Thank you, Matthew.

I'm starting to build my cake.

I'm setting things, then I put
more things together, then I set things.

[Matt] With so many elements to makeâ¦

This is my second batch of caramel.
Ready for the mousse.

â¦the bakers need their layers
to set quickly.

Adding the gelatin now.

[Matt] And so most are opting
for that notoriously tricky ingredient.

These are gelatin sheets
for the coffee mascarpone cream,

so it sets properly.

[Matt] But gelatin
can go spectacularly wrong.

It's quite tricky because you don't
want to have a layer of jelly,

'cause that's kind of gross.

[Matt] Add too much,

and meticulously-made elements
can turn to glue.

I'm settling somewhere in the middle,
hopefully that'll be okay.

I'm adding
the Bavarian layer to my charlotte.

It is already quite set.

There ya go.

[Crystelle] That is now gonna
chillax a little bit.

[Noel] As well as perfectly-set dessertâ¦

[Giuseppe] Okay, another thing done.

â¦the bakers require an exquisite finish
to take their bakes from the everydayâ¦

So this is what you call a mud pieâ¦

â¦into the extraordinary.

â¦but I'm going to turn this now
into a mirror glaze

with the addition of cream and sugar.

[Noel] But a set glaze
means reaching for the gelatin once more.

[Chigs] Ugh! This didn't happen
in the practice.

Thisâ¦ This jellyness.

Gonna pour it in
and see what happens.

This doesn't look good.
Put the gelatin in too quick.

Didn't read my instructions, did I?

This isn't right.

[motor struggling]

I flippin' hate caramel.
I'm gonna start again.

You here for the money shot, Noel?

Desperately trying
not to make a weird joke about that.

-[laughs] Yeah.
-[Noel laughs]

It's like molasses, it's so deep.

Gonna be able
to see your face in that?

-[Crystelle] Can you see yourself?
-Yeah. High-five!

-Yeah, man. Thanks.
-Good luck.

-[Giuseppe] Very sticky.
-[Chigs] Let's do round two.

Now do you know why
I call this the "Caramel Mistake"?

-[Matt] Hello, JÃ¼rgs!
-Hi, Matt.

JÃ¼rgs? What do people call you?
Do you have a nickname?

-No.
-JÃ¼rgchon.

-No.
-Erm, JÃ¼rg-ella? JÃ¼rgie?

Endless variations.

No one even calls you JÃ¼rgs?

As a German,
I don't understand this English thing

of putting an "s" at the end of a name.

Like, er, Matts.

Yeah, "Matts" doesn't really work. Matts.

[Chigs] That's more like it.

[Crystelle] Now it all comes to life
without a dome.

Can you tell them roughly
how long they've got?

Bakers you've got half an hour.

-I said "roughly."
-Oh, sorry.

[hoarsely] Bakers, you got half an hour.

Ah!

-[Chigs] George, you good?
-I think so, man. Sugar dome.

This is the scary bit.

I'm doing the stinking sugar dome.

[Matt] Domes are created
by pouring isomalt or sugar

over moulds of various kinds.

Weirdest thing I've ever done ever.
Dry a balloon.

I'm using the technique
with cling film over bowl.

[Matt] Most of the bakers
have chosen the more stable isomalt.

It just needs to be something
below 130.

[Matt] But in hope of a clearer domeâ¦

You think I'll get any points
for using sugar as opposed to isomalt?

â¦George has taken
the risky decision to use pure sugar.

I'm gonna keep my cool.

I'm gonna pour this into my dome
which I've lined with cling film.

[Matt] Paul and Prue will be looking
for a flawlessly transparent dome.

It's probably gonna be an imperfect dome,
but aren't we all imperfect?

And that's what I'm gonna tell
Paul Hollywood.

[Matt] The thinner the sugar,
the clearer the dome.

[Chigs] Double-dip
to make it a bit thicker.

It's like a crystal ball.
See the future, wow!

-You get through to next week.
-Whoa! [chuckles]

[Noel] But this brittle substance
is fickle.

Now I need to hold this for ten minutes.

-[Noel] Go too thinâ¦
-[groans]

â¦and the slightest pressure
will cause it to crack.

Very hit-and-miss in practice.

[Noel] But pouring the dome
is only the beginning.

I'm starting to sweat.

[Noel] Even if they decide
it's set enoughâ¦

Think I'm brave enough to let go.

â¦the bakers still have to unmould
their fragile creations.

[Crystelle] Sounds like
there's a lot of cracking going on.

[JÃ¼rgen] I think the sugar is set.

Oh.

[Lizzie] Let's pop the balloon, then.

Let's hope it doesn't shatter
when I take it out.

Good God.

[George] I'm so scared.

[Crystelle] Andâ¦ Oh, oh, oh.

Mother help me. 'Cause that justâ¦

That's a broken dome.

Beauty. Get in there.

Look, it's not not usable.

[Lizzie] I didn't like the drips of that.

How much time do we have?

Bakers, you have 15 minutes remaining.

-I'm gonna do it again.
-I'm gonna do another balloon.

Because the drips aren't even enough
and he's gonna be like, "No finesse."

I'm pretty pleased with it.

My dome is very hazy now.

If you warm it with a blowtorch,
it can get more transparent.

[JÃ¼rgen] Actually, it's perfect.

[Chigs] Could have been clearer,
but it's done.

-[laughs]
-Right. Dome number two.

[Lizzie] Gonna get "finesse"
tattooed on me.

Next is the final decoration.

-[JÃ¼rgen] Put my mango flower on.
-[Crystelle] Oh, there's a crack.

I think it's gonna break again.

Think I'm gonna have to start again.

Stressy, stress, stress.

[Lizzie] That looks well better.

-[Crystelle gasps] Yes! You did it.
-[exclaiming softly]

-How's yours going, Crystelle?
-I'm on my third one.

-Third?
-I'm gonna go for more isomalt.

[Noel] Come on, Crystelle,
you can do this.

Well, that'sâ¦ Yeah, that hasn't worked.

[hoarsely] Bakers, ten minutes left.

[Crystelle] Lizzie, how hard
is the balloon technique?

-[Lizzie] Start melting your isomalt.
-Yeah.

Crystelle, dome number seven.

[laughs]

So I'm gonna try the balloon technique
which I've never done in my life.

I'm gonna make it really thick.

-[Lizzie] Roses are a bit burnt.
-Five minutes until this is set

and I've got eight minutes
left of the challenge.

Ugh, I'm gonna be sick. [chuckles]

-[Giuseppe] Putting the dome in place.
-[George] Please don't break.

Bakers, you have five minutes remaining.

I think we're gonna
have to just pop it, aren't we?

[Lizzie] Just cut the bottom.
Can't get water on the thing.

[muttering indistinctly]

[Giuseppe] Final finishing touch.

[Chigs] Caramel layer
beginning to ooze out.

[Lizzie] Here you go, you peel it off now.

That's fine. You know what? That's okay.

Lizzie, you're the best person
in the world.

-Oh, my God!
-You've got to put it on the cake.

I have to do it now? I'll do it now.

Oh, my God, no.
No, no, no, no. [laughs]

[Noel chuckling] Is it stuck?

Oh, my God. No, no, no.

-Why did I do this?
-[Lizzie] Yeah, I can't.

That was like watching Charlie Chaplin.

"I've done it. I've made it.
I'll just put it in this sticky bowl."

Justâ¦ Okay.

Bakers, you will be relieved
to know your time is up.

You've gotta leave itâ¦ You've gotta do.

[Noel] Hands up, who's having
a heart attack on behalf of Crystelle?

[laughs]

Group heart attacks, everyone?

Oh.

[Matt] It's judgment time

for the bakers'
show-stopping caramel desserts.

Crystelle, would you like to bring up
your Showstopper, please?

What happened to the bowl?

It was a bit of
a last-minute rush at the end.

I ended up going with the balloon method

so I did it while it was quite warm.
It was gonna be bigger.

I like the look of the chocolate.
You got a lovely glaze on that chocolate.

-That looks lovely.
-[Prue] That's very beautiful.

I love the flavour.

-Sort of salted caramel chew.
-The biscuit layer is okay.

The chocolate layer on the top's
just too thick.

And your mousse is quite dry.

A mousse should be
like bubbles on the mouth.

-It's quite stodgy. Gelatin?
-Yeah.

-[Paul] Too much.
-It's a bit too much. Look, it's gluey.

So overall, I quite like the flavour,
even though it is rich.

You couldn't eat a lot of that,
but it looks lovely.

Thank you. I'll take that.

JÃ¼rgen, I think it looks
most spectacular.

I love the sponge fingers.

The isomalt looks really thick.

You've got quite a heavy collar here,
but the dome itself looks beautiful

'cause it's absolutely crystal-clear.

-Love the flower in the front.
-[Prue] Looks really good.

[Noel] Oh!

Oh, you are a piece of work.

-[Paul] Cut into it.
-[Matt] Oh, look at that.

[Prue] Gosh, that looks beautiful.

-Wow.
-[Matt] Wow!

[Prue] That looks so lovely

because the bavarois
are the same thickness.

The caramel at the bottom
and the pastry is really thin.

That's delicious.

Absolutely. Every layer
from the shortbread to the bavarois,

all the way to the top.

The passion fruit.

The praline, the lady's fingers.
The whole thing's beautiful.

-It's nice to have you back in the tent.
-Thank you very much.

-JÃ¼rgen, it's an absolute triumph.
-Thank you.

-Can't resist another.
-[Paul] Well done, thank you very much.

-[Matt] Well done.
-Smashed it.

-Lovely shaped dome. Very misty.
-Yeah.

[Paul] Looks like
a greenhouse in the winter.

[laughing]

Apart from that,
it's very elegant and neat.

[Noel] Oh, come on.

[all exclaiming]

-There's so much caramel.
-[Prue] Certainly tastes of caramel.

Actually, it's not too much.

Something's slightly wrong
about the textures.

The glueiness of the glaze
is a little unpleasant.

[Paul] Your mousse is all wrong,
it's like a wallpaper paste.

And it's heavy and stodgy and dry.
The glaze is too gluey.

-Put gelatin in there?
-I did. Yes.

[Paul] Probably a bit too much.

However, it does taste lovely.

-Looks a mess, doesn't it?
-[Chigs] Yeah.

[Paul] You've had a bit of leakage
and nothing's set.

-Doesn't look the right colour.
-[Chigs] No.

[Paul] It's too light.
The isomalt's too misty.

It's a shame 'cause you can't see
the chocolate work inside.

Let's take it off.

-I mean, that looks a lot better already.
-[all chuckle]

-[Paul] Ooh, look at that.
-[Prue] Thank you.

I love the even layers. Really nice.

The caramel wasn't taken
as far as it could've been,

which is why it's poured out.
Your dacquoise is nice.

It works with the coffee flavour.

I think the flavour
is absolutely delicious, Chigs.

Definite caramel, chocolate is just there.
The praline is delicious.

It's just all a bit liquid.

It's such a pity
'cause it's so nearly perfect.

-Yeah.
-Thank you, Chigs.

[Chigs] Cheers, guys, thank you.

Well, straight off the cuff
it looks amazing.

I like what you've done with that dome,
considering it's made from sugar.

That's difficult.
It's a nice-looking cake.

-George, I think it's beautiful.
-Thank you.

[Paul] This is gonna be
difficult in sugar.

-Oh, perfect.
-[Prue] Perfect.

Boom.

-[groans]
-[Prue chuckles]

-[Matt] Wow!
-[Noel] Mmm-hmm.

-I could eat a lot of that, George.
-[sighs]

It's a little too dry for me.

You've got dry chocolate ganache,
dry dacquoise,

then you got a little thin layer
of buttercream,

and then you have dacquoise again.

It needed a mousse or a bavarois
rather than just buttercream.

The taste is nice, but the textures,
for me, are too dry on the mouth.

[Prue] I know what you mean,

but I actually think that if you get
a mouthful of everything, it's delicious.

And I think you've done a really good job.

-Thank you very much, George.
-Thank you.

[whispering] Well done, George.

Well, it looks amazing.

As always with your bakes,
it's surprising and witty.

-I like it.
-We asked for finesse.

I think we've got it.

You've done an upside down dome,
which is unusual and brave.

Let's have a look, shall we?

[sighs] How am I gonna do this?

-I think I'm gonna need a spoon.
-[laughs]

I have never had sage caramel before.

-What do you think?
-The flavour's very strong.

To be very honest, Lizzie,
it doesn't look great inside there.

-It's a bit rough and ready.
-[Paul] It's just like a trifle.

You've got literally just a mess
of everything going on.

You've mashed it with the flowers.

[Prue] Funnily enough,
Paul says it's like a trifle.

It would be better
if it had a ton of custard in it,

because it's quite stodgy.

The roses are not great to eat,
and it's very sweet.

I've never had anything like it before.

-[Prue] I think it's very brave.
-Yeah, very brave.

-Thanks, Lizzie.
-Ta.

-Finesse.
-Finesse.

The tables have turned,
so now I'm all style and no substance.

He likes the flavours.
He loved the way it looked.

He just thought it was a bit dry.

Whether it's enough, I don't know.

I don't know who's gonna go home,
or who's gonna get Star Baker.

You know, I think we're
all pretty on edge, actually.

Definitely think
this is the tightest week. 100%.

Well, I think that the bakers will be glad
to see the back of caramel week.

-It's been really good in parts.
-Nice to see JÃ¼rgen come back.

I think the one that deserves a little pat
on the back was George for using sugar.

[Matt] He could've come in today
and said, "I'm beaten,"

but he came in
and really did himself proud.

Is it enough to save him?

And Lizzie, I have to say,
has not done herself proud.

The whole thing was sort of inedible.

Does this mean Lizzie
is near the bottom now?

It's her or George isn't it?

George has been struggling over the first
two challenges. He's built himself up.

And Lizzie's sort of dropped down.
Don't think he's on his own anymore.

I was a little bit upset
about Giuseppe's as well.

That was really gelatinous.

He's still got a good chance
of being Star Baker

'cause he did do so well
in the other two.

I think Crystelle is in line
for Star Baker

'cause she had not had a bad week.

JÃ¼rgen's had a pretty good week.

He did come second in the Technical,
and I think he's done really well today.

[Matt] So let's talk about Chigs.

I thought he did very well
in his Chignature.

Chigs got better every challenge
from Signature through to Showstopper.

At the end of the day,
I think you've got two people in trouble

and the other four in line for Star Baker.

Well done, bakers.
That was a tricky week. Caramel.

And I've got the amazing job of announcing
who is Star Baker this week.

And the person
who's Star Baker this week isâ¦

JÃ¼rgen.

[all clapping]

You're back, JÃ¼rgy-pops,
you're back.

-JÃ¼rgy-Popsy back.
-[all laugh]

And I have the unenviable task
of telling you who's going home

and what I will say is that
it was really close this week.

Could have been one of two people.

The person who's going is someone
we've all grown very close to

and we're all gonna miss a lot.

I'm afraid that the person
going home this week isâ¦

George.

-[Crystelle murmurs]
-It's all right, guys.

There is bittersweet to it.

My Showstopper, I was proud of.

-[Paul] I just think you ran out of steam.
-Yeah, I know.

It is very sad to see George go.

But, unfortunately, George
made more mistakes than Lizzie did.

Speaking to my family,
they're just so proud

that I've managed to kind of
even get in the tent.

So, yeah, week seven. I'm fine with that.

Well done, JÃ¼rgen. Well done.

I thought actually JÃ¼rgen did enough
to win Star Baker today.

[Prue] JÃ¼rgen was back
to his old self, wasn't he?

It was honestly one of the best desserts
I've ever tasted and I want the recipe.

-[Lizzie] How many is that now?
-[Crystelle] How many Star Bakers?

-[JÃ¼rgen] Three Star Bakers.
-[Crystelle] Good God!

-[woman] Hello darling. How are you?
-Hello.

Yes, Star Baker again.

-No way!
-[JÃ¼rgen] Yes.

-Oh, amazing.
-Yeah.

[Crystelle] Caramel!

We've got five of the strongest
bakers this year going through.

Quarter final? What the hell?

Yeah, it does feel all of a sudden
like we are in a serious competition now.

[Paul] Going into next week
is going to be a little bit different

and, I think, very difficult.

[closing theme music playing]

I can't get my head round this week.
Explain it to me again?

-It's Free-From Week.
-What does that mean?

It means this week
we've got a vegan bake,

we've got a dairy-free bake
and a gluten-free bake.

-Like this stuff here.
-Has anyone told Paul yet?

I just told him a couple of minutes ago.

-And he was fine with that?
-Yeah, absolutely fine.

[growling]

Let's scarper.

[snarling]

Actually, that's really nice.



Welcome to The Great British Baking Show.

[snarling]

[Matt] Now it's the quarter finalâ¦

Oh, bloody hell.

â¦and Free-From Week.

[coughs]

Nightmare.

[Matt] With a series
of challenges free from dairyâ¦

This one's tough
'cause Paul's a proper pudding lad.

-â¦meatâ¦
-[Giuseppe] Ohâ¦

Why is mine disgusting?

â¦and gluten.

-Organised chaos. [chuckles]
-[Prue] That's fine.

[Matt] But in order
to reach the semi finalâ¦



[Giuseppe] How long have we got left?

I'm just breaking my freezer.

â¦the bakers
will need to be free from disaster.

[JÃ¼rgen exclaims]

-I expected better from you.
-[sighs]

[opening theme music playing]

Week eight, quarter final.
Why am I still here? [laughs]

This Free-From Week,
I'm actually quite excited about it.

I never made anything dairy-free
or gluten-free or anything like that,

so I don't really know how it all tastes.

My objective
for this week is to survive. [laughs]

Just gotta keep everything
as Lizzie as possible.

I'm gonna prove a point
that free-from has as little finesse

as all me other food. [chuckles]

Good morning, bakers.

Welcome back to the tent
for the quarter final.

-Whoo!
-And a celebration of free-from baking.

[laughs] Free from baking, no baking.

We can just go lie down in hammocks
and eat some loganberry jam.

-Let's go. Oh.
-No, I think you've misunderstood.

-There's still baking? That's a shame.
-Yeah.

For your Signature Challenge,

the judges would like you each
to make a batch of eight

identical dairy-free ice cream sandwiches.

The ice cream must be beautifully made

and sandwiched between
two perfectly baked biscuits.

Any flavour you like.

Remember, kids, they must be dairy-free.

-You have three hours.
-On your marks.

-Get set.
-Bake.

I've had ice cream sandwiches.
I've never made them at home before.

I don't think anyone is doing
a dairy-free ice cream on a regular basis.

The aim is to get an ice cream

that sets, but is still creamy.
It's quite tricky.

[Paul] In this challenge,
we've asked them to be dairy-free.

They can use eggs, but obviously
the use of cream and butter is out.

I imagine we'll see a lot
of coconut milk and oat milk.

[JÃ¼rgen] This is coconut cream.
It's a bit thicker.

It has more fat than coconut milk.

We've asked for an ice cream sandwich
because we want a baked element.

[Paul] It's all about textures.

The silky smooth with the ice cream,
and the crispy biscuit.

How are they gonna do it?

We wanna see their characters coming out
but, above all, it must taste amazing.

-[Paul] Hey.
-[Lizzie] Hello!

Hello, Lizzie.

Tell us all about
your sandwich ice creams.

Erm, my dairy replacement
is oat milk and, like, fake cream.

And my sandwich ice creams are just
vanilla with, erm, some almond brittle in.

Because it's all about, like,
when I take my dog on a walk,

I see the Mr Whippy van after,
so she's allowed vanilla ice cream.

-[Prue] Oh.
-[Lizzie chuckles]

[Noel] Lizzie's almond,
praline and vanilla ice cream

will be sandwiched
between dark chocolate biscuits

embossed with a pattern
in honour of her dog Prue.

Can you explain
the meaning of this? [laughs]

It's all dogs,
'cause it's about walking my dog.

Are you gonna get
a bit of finesse with the pattern?

-Yeah.
-How big are these gonna be, the biscuits?

Oh, this is my issue, isn't it?
So they are about, I'd say, that lid size.

[Noel laughs]

-I thinkâ¦
-That's okay.

-[Lizzie] You don't think that's good?
-Lizzie, don't you be put off by him.

I never am, Prue.
I just don't listen to him.

[all laugh]

[Chigs] When I did my research,

dairy-free ice cream sets
slightly harder than normal ice cream.

Just trying to get as close
to normal ice cream as possible.

[Matt] The fat, sugar,
protein and water content

of the bakers' chosen dairy substitutes

will all affect the crystal formation
of their ice creams.

Rather than using whole milk,

I've got a plant-based, erm,
kind of cream, and a cashew nut milk.

[Matt] So it's crucial
they've researched how their alternatives

will impact the taste and texture.

[Giuseppe] The hope is that
the tofu will give the creaminess.

[Matt] And Giuseppe is taking
his dairy-free ice cream one step further.

The dairy alternative
will be tofu and soymilk.

So, the ice cream itself
is vegan and virtually fat-free.

-Wow.
-Delicious.

[all laugh]

No, actually, it does sound good.

[Matt] Rustic ginger
and maple syrup cookies

will contain Giuseppe's orange ice cream
made with silken tofu and soya milk.

One of the biggest challenges

has been to get the ice cream
to taste of orange enough.

So I'm using orange juice, orange zest

and candied orange peel to go into it.

I'm also adding a drop of orange essence,
and that should be enough.

[Noel] Also hoping
to pack a punch with his flavoursâ¦

-[Chigs] In goes the coconut milk.
-â¦is Chigs.

Gotta chop up nearly 600 grams of mangoes.

I know my mum's probably watching me,

"Why are you wasting
all that mango in there?" [laughs]

Not getting the best yield out of
the mango, but I ain't got time, soz.

[Matt] Sat between two pistachio
and cardamom biscuits,

Chigs is hoping
his mum's favourite tropical flavours

of mango, lime and coconut shine through.

But taste isn't Chigs' only concern.

Need to make sure it's creamy enough.

'Cause in the practice tent,
mine turned into a sorbet

'cause of the water content,
'cause I used different mangoes.

A lot of things will impact this.

-How's the practice gone for this?
-I left the freezer door open.

-Good.
-So, they all melted in the freezer.

Great.

So, that's how practice went.

[Giuseppe] I've added
all the flavours to the ice cream mix.

But I think I'm ready to go in there.

[Matt] With the ice cream
elements in placeâ¦

-[exclaiming]
-â¦it's time to get churning.

-[chuckles]
-[Crystelle] All right. In she goes.

What this will do is keep churning
and bring down the temperature.

Because it's dairy-free, you ain't gonna
get that proper silky stuff.

You will get a slightly firmer ice cream,

It's getting that balance right,
that's gonna overcome that.

And now we wait.

Painful wait and hopefully
that will turn into ice cream.

[Matt] As their ice cream churns,
the bakers can turn their attentions

to the outer layer of their sandwiches.

I've got dairy-free butter in here.

[Matt] JÃ¼rgen has opted for a simple way
to ensure his biscuits are dairy-free.

[JÃ¼rgen] Macarons are,
by definition, dairy-free,

but it feels counterintuitive to pour

120-degree hot liquid into egg whites.

And then I need
to whisk it until it's cooled.

[Matt] JÃ¼rgen's macarons of egg whites
with ground pistachio and almond

will sandwich his banana
and coconut ice cream,

combining two of his
favourite childhood flavours.

Over the years, when I was
testing ice cream parlours in Germany,

I developed
my test case for the parlours,

and that was a mix
of pistachio and banana ice cream.

You used to test the ice cream parlours?

-[JÃ¼rgen] Yes.
-I mean, is this an official job? Orâ¦

-[all laugh]
-Just my internal one.

-Right.
-[all laugh]

Can't have it too big, 'cause obviously
the rolling pin's not massive,

so you've got to do two at a time.

This dough is so wet and sticky.
I'm just gonna bake them like this

and then I will re-cut them out.

It's like a safety net.

[Noel] And Crystelle has good reason
to be cautious about her biscuits.

I have only done these once
because I changed my recipe last minute,

so I am quite panicky about them.

[Noel] Crystelle is hoping

the earthiness of her cashew milk
and coffee ice cream

will complement the nutty flavours

of her tahini and miso
replacement biscuits.

I had a really nice cookie recipe

that was chewy,
but I just didn't think it froze well.

I've gone for one that you can take
a bite, the ice cream doesn't ooze out.

-Sounds good.
-What were you doing?

Miso and tahini frappuccino
ice cream sandwich.

-Yeah.
-[all laugh]

[hesitating] You know, very simple.

Bakers, you have
an amount of time remaining.

That wasn't very helpful.

Well, it's Free-From Week,
so I thought I would do a time call

that was free from
the relevant information.

Bakers, you're halfway through.

[Chigs] These are gonna
go in the oven now.

So, 12 minutes.
I'm gonna do six minutes on each side.

Fifteen minutes.

Then I'll swap them round
seven minutes in.

[Giuseppe] So, in we go.

[Noel] While the other bakers' biscuits
begin to increase in temperatureâ¦

It's still warm.

â¦JÃ¼rgen's meringue mix
has the opposite problem.

-Hello, JÃ¼rgenâ¦ [laughs]
-Hi, Noel.

-I've been there about half an hour.
-Ah, yes.

You look very interested
in what's going on in there.

[JÃ¼rgen] Yes,
I'm trying to cool this down.

I had some issues
with that in the practice tent.

-Oh, no.
-I don't want to repeat that here.

[Noel] You don't seem
to be under pressure, though.

How many Star Bakers have you won now?

-Three. Yes.
-Three?

Imagine if Crystelle
won three Star Bakers. [chuckles]

-Yeah, we would be deaf by now.
-[laughs]

They look okay.
The biscuits are looking good.

-Oh, there we go.
-[timer beeping]

Got a bit of colour round the edge,
which I'm happy with.

Oh, I forgot to sprinkle
sesame seeds on the top of these,

but it's fine
because these can go on the bottom.

There's some funky smells
coming from over here.

It's the dark cocoa.

-[Noel] What percentage is that?
-It's black. 100%.

-Hundred percent cocoa?
-Yeah.

Oh, my God. It's giving me a stitch.

-[coughs]
-Do you know what it reminds me of?

-When you--
-Inside of a coffin?

[both laugh]

No, I was gonna say Jaguar wee.

-Jaguar wee?
-Yeah.

Wow, you're weirder than me.
It's official. Jaguar wee. [laughs]

[JÃ¼rgen] Still doesn't
look like a meringue.

I'll give it a bit more.

But now the machine's blinking,
so the ice cream is essentially done.

At least I can start
shaping my sandwiches.

[Matt] The ice cream needs to be set
for sandwiching in the uniform shapes

Paul and Prue will be expecting.

[Lizzie] Oh, my God, that's so cold.

I use silicon moulds,
but the silicon moulds are a bit small,

so this is going to be
slightly interesting.

[Crystelle] So, I realise in practice
that my moulds are very thick,

so I'm only gonna fill them halfway.

And the best way to do that
is to use a piping bag.

[Matt] While Crystelle and JÃ¼rgen
have changed moulding methodsâ¦

I was gonna go for a rustic look.

[Matt] â¦Giuseppe has decided
to break the mould completely.

The ice cream is starting
to lose consistency,

so I'm going to have to be very quick.
Otherwise, I will lose this.

These are gonna go in the freezer.

[Matt] With the sandwich centres freezing,

it's time for top deck decoration.

[whispers] Disco time.

[JÃ¼rgen, normally]
I'll go for it now, I think.

[Matt] But without anything baked yet,

there's no time for JÃ¼rgen
or his meringue to rest.

In the practice, I didn't whisk
the Italian meringue long enough.

I was too impatient.

This has this nice, rough structure
that this mix should have.

[Giuseppe] I'm drizzling
my top biscuits with, uh,

tempered dairy-free white chocolate.

Then I'll add the candied orange peel
and crystallised ginger.

[Lizzie] On the wrong
Channel 4 programme here.

Should be on Grayson Perry's art show.

I'm going in.
I didn't dry them out in the practice

and they actually came out nice.

How much time do we have left?

-Bakers, you have 8,000 wobble mittensâ¦
-[snickers]

â¦in your tiger chop suey.

-What was that?
-That was free from logic.

[Matt] You have 15 minutes left.

Well, that just gives them
time to cool down, doesn't it? [chuckles]

[Lizzie] Paul doesn't like glitter.

Who cares what Paul thinks?

This one's tough, 'cause Paul's not
the biggest fan of free-from stuff, is he?

He's a proper pudding lad, innit?

[Crystelle] Sesame seeds for sprinkling

because I forgot
to sprinkle enough on them.

[Noel] How's it going? [chuckles]

-Oh, I don't know. I just--
-Yeah, whatever.

[laughs] I knew you didn't care.

[all chuckle]

[chuckling] Is it going all right?

-Oh, I don't know.
-[yawns]

-[both laughing]
-See you later.

I fall for this every single time.

[JÃ¼rgen] They're spreading
underneath and moving up.

Let's go for it.

Interesting shape, isn't it?

They shouldn't have this little fringe.

They will have enough time cool,
they cool very quickly.

You anxious?
I can see you're shaking your legs.

I got that weird feeling that I've got--
I've missed something.

-Well, the dairy.
-[laughs]

If that's the only thing I've missed,

-I'mâ¦ Yeah.
-You're all right.

How long do we have?

Bakers, you have five minutes left.

Now is the time to add
some dairy, I would say.

[chuckles]

I'm just breaking my freezer.

[indistinct chatter]

We have a few air pockets,
but it'll have to do.

Press it down, because why not?
I've touched it enough.

What I'm actually gonna do
just for ease of assembly is, base in.

Oh!

Oh, that's so cute.

[JÃ¼rgen] That's pretty awful.

[Chigs exclaims]

[JÃ¼rgen] And they don't hold together.

Oh. Bloody hell.

[JÃ¼rgen] And macarons are not right.

Bakers, you have one minute left.

[sighs]

Oh, bugger, am I breaking this biscuit?
Didn't think this through, did I?

[Giuseppe] I haven't moulded
the ice cream. In hindsight, I could've.

But I think that this suits
the whole shape better.

[Lizzie] It just looks like
I've been playing in the mud.

I have washed my nails, people of Britain.

I'm a bit annoyed about the air pockets,
but otherwise, yeah, happy.

-Happy, happy, happy.
-[Crystelle] Last bugger.

Bakers, your time is up.

Done. Done, done, done.

Please place your ice cream sandwiches
at the end of your workstations.

There is an element of, erm,
[chuckling] church decor in there.

Well, there's always another Technical
to redeem myself. [laughing]

[birds chirping]

[Noel] It's judgment time

for the bakers'
dairy-free ice cream sandwiches.

They're a little uneven. Rather huge.

[Paul] You've lost
a bit of the definition in the cuts.

[Prue] I think you could've forgotten
about telling us about the dogs

because they've disappeared.

Actually, I love the texture.

It's very dry and very crumbly.

I didn't think I was going to like it.
[snickers] I do.

There is a chocolatey hint to it,
which is slightly bitter,

which marries it beautifully
with the ice cream.

It's got a nice vanilla kick in it,
but you've got that praline as well.

I would've blitzed that really small
and folded that through

so you'd have ended up
with a bit more praline in your mouth.

What you do get is very good,
it's just messy.

-Which is normal for you, isn't it?
-Yeah.

[all chuckle]

But I think your flavours
and consistency are good.

-Ta.
-Thanks, Lizzie.

Thanks, guys.

-They are beautiful, Chigs.
-Thank you.

[Prue] Really beautiful.

-Very professional looking.
-[Chigs] Thank you.

[Prue] Look at that. Neat as a pin.

-The mango. Needs lots more.
-[Chigs] Mmm-hmm?

I think canned mango pulp
would have been better.

Not a lot of flavour
coming from the biscuit.

-[Chigs] Okay.
-Ermâ¦

Great texture, though.

The ice cream,
you do get the mango very subtly.

You do get that coconut as well.

But it's not going to last long,
it is very sorbet-like.

But, over all, it is nice. The ice cream
just needs more of a punch.

Okay. Thank you, guys.

Did you rest them before you baked them?

I didn't, because the Italian meringue
took so long to cool down.

The whole thing about a macaron
is the resting that creates the skin

which creates the dome,
which you do not have.

-Therefore, you end up with that.
-Yes.

[Prue] But you might have invented
something which is very suitable.

This is very chewy.

I like it.

-Chewy and almondy.
-[JÃ¼rgen] Mmm-hmm.

The nuts, you do get beautifully,
but the ice cream's the star here.

-Thank you.
-It's fantastic.

-Intense flavour of bananas.
-[Prue] Mmm-hmm.

-I think that's lovely.
-Hmm.

-Really good, JÃ¼rgen.
-Thank you very much.

-[exhales]
-Well done.

[Prue] Delicious.

It's a nice-looking, very uniform set.

[Prue] I absolutely agree.
It looks tempting and I want one.

[Crystelle chuckles] Good.

I think the flavour is absolutely lovely.

The texture of the ice cream
is a bit light and wet.

-That--
-I actually really like it. Yeah.

I've never had anything like that before.

No, the tahini in the biscuit
is akin to a sort of shortbread.

And the sesame comes through quite nicely.

Coffee levels
are perfect in the ice cream.

It is very flavoursome
and it holds on the tongue as well

which blends quite well.

I think you've done a good job.

I think you've done a really nice job.

-Well done, Crystelle.
-[Paul] Hmm. Thank you.

What? [chuckles]

[Prue] I think they look lovely.
Very interesting. It's almost got a--

[Paul] Looks like a craquelin. Yeah.

I think you've managed
pretty consistent shapes.

Let's have a look.

You said this is made with tofu?

Yes, this is made with tofu and soymilk.

[Prue] It's definitely not
as creamy as I thought it would be.

But the flavour is lovely.

Mmm, texture's fantastic.

It's a very short crispy biscuit, which,
just on its own, would be delicious.

But the ice cream is great.

The orange comes through, cooked through.
You do get a hit of the ginger as well.

[Prue] Oh,
the whole thing is just delicious.

You've done a great job with that.

I would love that just bashed up
in a bowl with a spoon and eat the lot.

[Prue] It's lovely.

-[Paul] Very clever.
-Thank you.

I don't have any
past experience in free-from,

so, this is probably
the most pleased I've ever been.

[Lizzie] What's new?

It's too big, don't look neat,
but they liked the flavours.

I was very nervous about my macarons.

But Prue liked myâ¦ [chuckles] "invention."

[Chigs] I think the others got amazing
feedback on their flavours,

and I didn't, so I need to
come out swinging in the Technical.

[Matt] The bakers were able
to practise their dairy-free Signature,

but they have no idea
what the Technical will be free from.

You lucky things,
it's time for your Technical,

which today has been set by the Prue.

-The Prue, any words of advice?
-Yes.

Flavour always matters,
but in this recipe it's absolutely key.

Thank you. Well, as ever,
this task is judged blind,

so we ask the judges to leave the tent.

[Noel] Where do you think they've gone?

To the dogs, mate,
like the rest of this country.

It's got to the point you can't even
put meat in a vegan recipe.

Honestly, you couldn't make it up.

For your Technical Challenge,
Prue would love you to make

eight identical vegan sausage rolls.

[Matt] Your sausage rolls should comprise

of crisp, golden, vegan rough puff pastry,

surrounding a mushroom and walnut filling.

They should be accompanied by a sticky,
caramelised red onion chutney.

[Matt] You have two hours.

-On your marks.
-Get set.

-[Noel] Bake.
-[Crystelle] Oh, for God's sake.

[Lizzie] I've made vegan sausage rolls
but not with mushrooms and walnuts.

Who doesn't like a sausage roll?

Haven't made sausage rolls before.
I haven't made vegan rough puff pastry.

This is going to be really interesting.

And interesting in every bad
sense of the word.

So, Prue, tell us all about
your vegan sausage rolls.

We're looking for eight
perfectly identical vegan sausage rolls

with really well laminated, crisp
rough puff pastry.

What fat do you put in the pastry?
Because you can't use butter.

No, it's a vegan block.

It's got almond, coconut and rapeseed oil

and then you treat it just like butter
when you're making rough puff.

I'm really quite impressed because it
has made really nice little laminations.

[Paul] They'll struggle with this,

with the vegan block,
which tends to melt very quickly.

If they chill it enough,
they'll be all right.

You just have to keep chilling it.

Mmm! Together with the chutney,
it's delicious.

The pastry is beautifully light.

And it's really flaky.
You wouldn't know it was vegan pastry.

Well, it's the quarter finals.

And I think this is
a very challenging Challenge.

It's certainly more difficult than
a straightforward sausage roll.

So, "Number one:
Make the dough for the rough puff."

Uh, we got flour, vegan block,
salt and water.

I've never used vegan block before.

It's got a very odd appearance.

It's going to be interesting
to see what it looks like.

I'm worried about the puff pastry because
I can't remember the last time I made it.

I'm looking for
the whole thing to bind together.

There you go.

And you see now it's clumping up.
I don't want to overhydrate the flour

'cause it'll become too sticky
to work with.

[JÃ¼rgen] The dough needs to be firm

but a little bit pliable.

I feel like maybe I didn't put
enough water in my pastry.

Just gonna go with it
and hope that it works.

"Number two: Laminate the dough
using the frozen vegan block."

[Chigs] It looks like tofu, it's weird.

[Lizzie] It laminates,
so once you roll it out,

it creates layers, and then,
in the oven, the butter melts

and creates steam
which puffs the pastry up.

Do you like laminating?

-I like makin' a puff pastry. Yeah.
-Do ya?

-This is actually--
-That's why you're making me one?

[chuckling] Yeah.

"Complete four single turns."

[groaning] I have no idea what that means.

[Chigs] I'm gonna go
for a normal book fold.

A third of it over, another third over
and turn it. Gotta do that four times.

I don't know if it'll be the way they
want it to be, but it'll be laminated.

[Crystelle] That's fold number two.

Why is mine disgusting?

[Lizzie] Close the sides in
so nothing comes out.

Is this for the puff business?

This is for the puff business
and this is a bad thing here.

[Noel] Butter come through?

-[JÃ¼rgen] The butter leaked out.
-[Noel] Oh, no.

-What could that mean?
-Bad lamination.

[Noel] Bad lamination.

What could that mean?

-We want loose laminations.
-Eh, Star Baker?

What could that mean?

[chuckling] "Cross Paul." Paul be cross.

And now I'm going
to wrap this and chill it.

[Giuseppe] It needs to be
resting in between folding.

So I'm gonna be putting this
in the fridge for another ten minutes.

[Chigs] Let the butter solidify again.

If the butter melts,
it'll ooze out in the oven.

I wanna keep it chilled
so it stays in the pastry.

[Lizzie] What am I doing?

"Finely chop the mushrooms and walnuts,
fry the onions."

[sighs heavily]

I like a veggie sausage roll,
but I don't normally make the middle bit.

I get the veggie sausages
and smush them with a fork

and throw them in some puff pastry.

-Easier, isn't it, than all this faffing?
-Something savoury for a change.

-Yeah, exactly.
-[Noel] Paul loves savoury.

He won't be able to resist getting his
sausage roll fingers onto sausage rolls.

-[both chuckling]
-Onto the sausage rolls.

-That's how he measure out the sizes.
-[laughs]

He puts his index finger down.

[Giuseppe] I do a lot of cooking at home.

I usually do this at least once a week

'cause my son Georgio's favourite pizza
is mushroom pizza.

[Crystelle] Once I've got that in the pan,
I'll go back to my pastry.

"Four single turns."

I might be doing double turns.

I'm very confused with lamination.

[Chigs] That's it.

Turns done.

I will save this now until later.

Bakers, you are halfway through.

-What was that?
-That was free from comedy.

We're good at that.

Jeez, already?

"Number four: Add the lentils,
miso, flaxseed,

lemon juice, parsley, sage and thyme."

That's quite a complex recipe.

[Lizzie] Mmm! Tasty!

[Crystelle] Miso! Hello, old friend.

This is different from this morning's,

but I guess this is what
gives it the meaty flavour

that you miss from actual meat.

Parsley, sage and thyme.

Do they do sausage rolls much in Italy?

Ah, yes! They call them differently.
They're called rustici.

-Ruâ¦ rustici?
-Rustici.

-[Matt in Italian accent] Rustici.
-[Giuseppe] Rustici.

-Rustici.
-Good enough!

[operatically] Rustici! Rustici!

-Don't do the--
-Rustici!

-There you go.
-Rustici.

Everybody make your rustici!

Rustici!

[laughs] I love the voice.

That's my mixture done.
I'm happy with that.

Let's get this pastry out and rolled out.

We have to carve eight rectangles
10 centimetres by 15 out of this.

So it needs to be relatively thin.

Damn it! Is that not enough pastry?

[Lizzie] At this point, it's just getting
stuff done, isn't it?

It's dodgy as, but it's eight.

[Crystelle] I've got off-cuts.
See what I can do with this.

For God's sake, come on, Crystelle!

"Cut ten diagonal slits

through the top half
of the pastry rectangle."

[Chigs] Sixâ¦ sevenâ¦

[Lizzie] Eightâ¦ nineâ¦ ten.

[Chigs] I'm gonna start
makin' the sausage rolls now.

Gross.

I was gonna measure this out,
but I don't have time.

This is not gonna look neat.

It is very rushed.

[Crystelle] And seal. I mean,
this is shoddy, isn't it?

[Lizzie] Paul's going to be, like,
"The crimp on that is awful."

[Noel] Have you made
vegan sausage rolls before?

Yeah, me little sister
is, like, a veggie vegan.

-[Noel] Is she?
-Yeah, she's dead cool.

[Noel] All the dead-cool kids are vegan,
aren't they?

-Yeah.
-Are you vegan?

-No.
-[Noel] Okay.

-I'll leave it there.
-[chuckles]

All right, glaze.
One tablespoon of almond milk,

and one tablespoon of agave,

which I'm gonna eyeball. There.

[Crystelle] Why do I always
end up rushing in this?

[Giuseppe] Ahâ¦ Ooh!

Goin' in.

[Crystelle] They'll have to go in.

-I mean, they're disgustingly ugly.
-[oven beeps]

[oven beeping]

I'll check after 20.

Until they're brown.

That's a bit of a rush. [exhales]

You have half an hour left.

[Lizzie] Half an hour.
Let's go, go, go, go.

"Make the caramelised red onion chutney."

More choppin'.

-[Chigs] Sizzle.
-[JÃ¼rgen] Balsamic vinegar.

I haven't made a chutney.
Not so sure about the flavour.

-[Chigs] How much chilli does it say?
-[Crystelle] I did a whole chilli.

-One red chilli, finely chopped.
-I don't know how much to put in.

I'm gonna go with that much.

Oh! Ooh.

[clears throat] Spicy chutney.

It needs to get all gooey and sticky.
How long have we got?

Bakers, you have ten minutes left.

[oven beeps]

They're rising. That's a good sign
you've done something right. [chuckles]

My pastry looks like short crust pastry.

And I laminated it.

Get more colour! Get more colour!

[JÃ¼rgen] I'm just turning the tray.

-[tray clatters]
-[gasps]

This is bad. [sighs]

You didn't see it. [laughs]

Bakers, you have one minute left.

That's it. Coming out.

I'm doing it!

Yeah, looks done to me.

[sarcastically] Oh, yummy! Don't these
look appetising? Oh, dear, oh, dear.

They're done. So, another try.

These ones look better.

[JÃ¼rgen] Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

[Giuseppe] It looks and tastes good.

I'd eat that.

Bakers, your time is up!

Nightmare.

Please bring your bakes to the table

and place them behind your photograph.

[Noel] Paul and Prue are looking for
eight crisp and beautifully laminated

vegan sausage rolls.

Made with vegan rough puff pastry,

and served with caramelised onion chutney.

-Bit of a mixed bag, isn't it?
-[Paul] Let's start with this one?

There should be a better glaze on the top.

[Paul] I'm happy with the colour.
It's very thin.

But they've sealed the edges
as well as the front.

-The flavour is okay. Good balance.
-[Prue] Mmm.

Actually, the um,
onion chutney is good as well.

I like the mixture inside because
it's crumbly and soft. Lovely!

[Paul] Okay, moving on to these pasties.

[Prue chuckles] I mean,
they're meant to look like sausage rolls.

[Paul] It's a bit rough and ready.

The flavour's not bad, actually.
Did get a mouthful of nuts.

The onion chutney looks good.

I think the vegan
shortening has run out of it.

So it's rather tough.

I know, there's a lot of
chilli in that. [chuckles]

[coughs]

[Prue] My nose is running
'cause of the chilli.

Wow! Milk, please!

You can have some oat milk.

[all laughing]

-Happy with the chilli.
-[both laugh]

[Prue] That's a lot of chilli. Right.

This one is a lot better looking.

I think these are flat,
but they all look pretty much the same.

[Paul] Problem is the seals are so big.

Good mushroom flavour.

[Paul] Mmm! Mushroom flavour is there.

I think they're a bit overbaked.

-[Paul] A bit dry.
-[Prue] Mmm.

[Paul] Moving on,
this one is definitely overbaked.

-[Prue] But the lamination is quite good.
-[Paul] Yeah, the lamination you can see.

It's definitely overbaked,
but the flakiness is excellent.

It's dried out the interior, so it's drawn
the moisture out from the mushroom.

On to the last one.

-[Prue] They're a bit big and clumsy.
-[Paul] They are.

-[Paul] The colour looks nice.
-[Prue] Mmm.

-[Paul] It's a bit dry.
-[Prue] I like the flavour.

-[Paul] It is okay.
-[Prue] It is herby, but I like it.

[Paul] Okay.

[speaking indistinctly]

[Matt] Paul and Prue will now rank
the vegan sausage rolls

from worst to first.

In fifth place, we have this one.

Crystelle, not good shape,
not good glaze, too much chilli.

-Crystelle, come here a minute.
-Oh, good God.

-You want me to try that chutney?
-[Prue] He'll give you a handful.

-I actually did, I--
-[Paul] Did you try it?

-I kept the seeds in.
-You want more than that.

-Oh.
-[all laughing]

I did try it.

I mean, I'm okay with spice but--
[clears throat]

[all laugh]

Oh, I wish I had your timing.

I apologise.

In fourth spot, we have this one.

It's a bit of a mess, JÃ¼rgen.

It's all over the place.
It's too thick and untidy.

Third place, we have this one.

Lizzie, they all look quite good.

But they are very overbaked.

Second, we've this one.

Giuseppe, it's not bad.

They're just too flat
and you've used too much seam.

It needs to be bolder and a thinner seam.

Which means,
this one is in the first place.

It looks good, it tastes good.

It's moist inside
and the chutney is lovely.

-[Crystelle] Bravo!
-[all applaud]

And the winner gets to eat
all of Crystelle's chilli.

[all laugh]

Oh, my God, first!
I feel like I've got a full house now.

I've got a handshake,
I've got a Star Baker,

first in the Technical.

I'm well happy.
I needed that after this morning.

[sighs] Not my finest hour.

I feel like I'm definitely in
the running to go home.

But I just hope and pray
tomorrow is a better day for me.

It's pretty level.
Even playing field, yet again.

So it all counts on tomorrow.

It's exciting, isn't it? [chuckles]

[Matt] That was a Technical

in which you weren't very happy
with anyone, were you?

This was the week we needed Freya, really.

She'd have loved doing that.

The Signature over all was good.
They all did well.

But, for me, at the front is,
of course, Giuseppe.

He's the one to beat.

I mean, the likes of Chigs, who did well
in the Technical, could catch up.

But Giuseppe, if he drops it,
they're all going to be on him.

The problem is, I can't see
Giuseppe taking his eye off the ball.

Who's in trouble?

[Paul] Both Lizzie and Crystelle,
coming into the Showstopper,

are the ones down at the bottom.

Crystelle is just so erratic.

She could be a bit more consistent
instead of genius or terrible.

[Prue] But Lizzie
is almost determined to not be neat.

And I want to strangle her
because she's a good baker,

-she's great--
-Be good TV.

-You must stop killing people.
-[chuckling] Strangling the baker.

[Matt] We've talked about this.

Hello, bakers. Welcome back to the tent.

It's time for your Showstopper Challenge.

For your Free-From Showstopper Challenge,

the judges would like you to create
a visually spectacular, gluten-free

celebration cake.

[Noel] It needs
to be beautifully decorated,

and your cake must have
at least two tiers.

[received pronunciation] Like the two
tears I shed for my gluten brothers

who've been cast aside
for the wants and vagaries of fashion.

You have four hours.

-On your marks.
-Get set.

Please do bake.

[Noel, normally] The gluten-free
revolution began in the 1950s,

when it was linked to
a host of medical conditions.

My sister-in-law,
she's intolerant to gluten,

so she avoids it as much as possible.

[Noel] Gluten can be found in all flour
made with barley, rye and wheat.

A sponge traditionally uses plain flour.
They haven't got that option,

so they've got to think,
"What flour am I going to use?"

[Prue] You can do all sorts of flours,

but because they don't have gluten,

they tend to make a cake
that easily breaks apart

and it's quite a good idea
to give it more solidity

by adding quite a lot of eggs and butter.

[Lizzie] There is a lot of eggs
on the go today.

Twenty-five? It's an omelette cake,
basically. [chuckling]

I expect the texture to be
the same as a traditional cake.

They really need to bring their A-game
to get through to that semi final

and get a chance
to get into the final this year.

-[Paul] Hi, Crystelle.
-Hi, good morning.

Tell us about your gluten-free
celebration cake.

It's dedicated to my grandma,

who's celebrating
a very big birthday this year.

Before my sister's engagement, she planned
out her dress for my sister's wedding,

and hanging on the back of her door.

So, I'm going to pipe
my grandma's cascading dress.

-Goodness.
-Wow.

Going all out, cause I'm on thin ice,

and I really want
to prove myself and stay.

[Matt] As well as an ambitious
full-length gown piped in buttercream,

Crystelle is sandwiching Jaggery creme pat
between her gluten-free sponges,

flavoured with coconut,
walnut and cardamom.

This is cardamom from home which has been
roasted and ground to a fine powder.

Here we've got rice flour.

I've found that rice flour,
funnily enough, works okay,

so I just went with rice flour in the end.

[Matt] To make their sponges,

most of the bakers
are using a gluten-free alternative

to traditional flour.

[Lizzie] Coconut flour
absorbs liquid like mental.

[Matt] And for fluffiness,
are mixing in a key additive.

[Crystelle] So this is Xanthum gum.

Clearly, I know loads about it.
I can't pronounce the stinking thing.

It's a natural product.

And it acts as a stabiliser and a binder.

Like gluten in wheat flour.

[Matt] But for his gluten-free creationâ¦

[Giuseppe] I've tried to stay away from
the additives and tricks you can use.

Mostly because I'm not familiar with them.

â¦Giuseppe has
a different strategy altogether.

I'm using a recipe
which is naturally gluten-free.

It doesn't include any flour.

But, by whipping the egg white separately,

I'm incorporating a bit more air
and giving it more fluffiness.

[Noel] His plan to go
flour-free is a risk,

but it's not just the sponge
that may fall flat

if he doesn't get the gluten-free version
of Black Forest Gateau just right.

[Giuseppe] As far as I know,

the Black Forest is Paul's favourite cake
and Prue doesn't really like itâ¦

Oh.

â¦so I've put myself
in a very awkward position.

You've split the judges,
which is definitely the right thing to do.

-[both laughing]
-On week eight.

-Good luck.
-Wedge them out.

-Yikes.
-[both chuckle]

[Matt] Like Giuseppeâ¦

[Chigs] I'm going to add
the apple cider vinegar now.

You won't get the acidity of the vinegar,
you'll get a background of it.

Won't be like
your fish and chips. [chuckles]

â¦Chigs is also pinning his hopes on a
gluten-free version of a popular classic.

[Chigs] I'm making
a two-tiered red velvet cake.

So, my cousin is gluten-free.
He's been gluten-free for,

I think, about two years now.

So, he was my guinea pig for this cake.

I got a good review from him.

So, it's all riding on him
for this to turn out well.

[Noel] Featuring an ornate
filigree chocolate collar,

his two-tier red velvet cake
will be filled with strawberry jam

and alternating layers of chocolate
and vanilla cream-cheese frosting.

-[Matt] Are you fan of free-from baking?
-I don't know how I feel about it.

-Really?
-It's all right.

I'd rather have the full-fat stuff.

[Crystelle] So, I'm doing two tiers,

and each tier
I've got three layers of sponge.

So, six layers
of sponge in total.

[Matt] With multiple spongesâ¦

So, these are all going to go in.

â¦each requiring a different bake timeâ¦

These should be done within 30 minutes.

That's going to take another 15 minutes
on top cause it's a thicker cake.

â¦anything less than total precision,

and they can kiss goodbye
to cakes with a uniform texture.

[Chigs] So, they're going at 160,
for 25 minutes.

I'm gonna have to rotate them.

[Matt] But for
his super-size Showstopperâ¦

I'm going for the three tiers.

[Matt] â¦it's even more
of a challenge for JÃ¼rgen.

[JÃ¼rgen] So, white chocolate,
milk chocolate and dark chocolate.

That means three sponges
of each colour for each tier.

Means nine sponges.

I calculated for 80 people.

It's going to be really big.

[Noel] To up the chocolate ante
even further,

JÃ¼rgen will be separating his sponges
with chocolate buttercream

and decorating with chocolate ombre,
and a chocolate ganache drip.

[JÃ¼rgen] My inspiration is my wife.

She loves chocolate cakes and she's

always screaming for the perfect
chocolate cake for her birthday.

So, this is inspired by that.

[Noel] While JÃ¼rgen's out to impress
his wife and the judges

with the sheer size of his Showstopper,

Lizzie is taking
a more philosophical approach.

I'm celebrating being different.
It'll be a representation of my brain.

Because I've got quite a few SEN issues.

SEN is special educational needs.

Dyslexic, dyspraxic, ADHD
and concentration disorder.

I think people who are
slightly different need to be celebrated,

and represented.

I just love the idea of it
all being your personality. It's great.

And the decorations also, you know,
like the '70s shag rugs that you get.

-Yeah.
-That's what it's going to look like.

[all laughing]

[Matt] Rice paper thins

covered with a jumble of letters
and numbers to represent Lizzie's dyslexia

will protrude from two tiers
of coconut flour sponge

filled with pineapple jam

and coated in a kaleidoscopic shag pile
of Italian Meringue Buttercream.

You know, like, brain force,
like I get a lot of brain force,

that's what that's meant to represent.

Concentrate on your decoration,
your finesse. All right?

It's gonna be my brain.
There's gonna be no finesse to it.

-Organised chaos.
-[Prue chuckling] That's fine.

Cake should be ready.

[Lizzie] I'm coming out.

[Noel] With numerous bakes to juggleâ¦

I think Cake Tetris.

For another two minutes.

â¦and a long list of fillings
and decorations to get readyâ¦

Cream cheese, 400 grams, come on.
There you are, that'll do.

â¦the bakers now face
a multitasking minefield.

[Giuseppe] Got the cake
baking in the oven,

so I'm also making the cherry jam.

You can't have a Black Forest
without some kirsch.

Coming out and going in.

[Matt] But nobody is feeling
the pressure more than JÃ¼rgenâ¦

One.

â¦who is yet to make all his cake batter.

[JÃ¼rgen] Two.

Three.

So, I need to keep my head together.

I'm going to whisk up my third sponge,
which is my chocolate sponge.

[Crystelle] This is jaggery,
which is from my grandma.

It's almost like
a really dark brown sugar.

I use it a lot when I'm cooking
just to sweeten curries and stuff.

-[Noel] Week 8, quarter finals.
-[Crystelle] Yeah.

You have a good Showstopper,
you're in the semi finals.

It is absolutely mad.

You can do it, as well. You've got skills.

Noel, this is the nicest
you've ever been to me.

I'm really shocked.
Usually it's, "Why are you here?"

-I know you respond to a bit of banter.
-I do. I am, my--

If I said to JÃ¼rgen, you know,
"Why are you here?"

[both laughing]

[Noel, mimicking] "Because I'm
an efficient, powerful scientific baker."

-[laughing]
-"Why are you here?"

And I'd go,
"Good point. I'd better get my coat."

[both laughing]

[Chigs] Right.
This is the last of my cakes now.

That's cooled.

Oh, so hot.

There's no more baking left to do.

So now it's all about stuff cooling down
and decorating.

[JÃ¼rgen] Last three.

It's about time.

Bakers, you have one hour left.

What's happening here?

Oh, we're free from the tent.

Oh.

-[Noel] It's nice out here. The nature.
-[Matt sighs happily]

Nice.

Shall we strip off?

[chuckles] Again?

-Yeah.
-Yeah.

[Chigs] All right,
I'm gonna start building now.

[Giuseppe] It looks baked.

It is, uh, chewy inside,
which is what it's supposed to be.

There's another plate spinning.
I'm coming out.

Cooling times are usually
the limiting times.

Oh, it's going to be tight.

[Lizzie] Okay. That is pineapples,
jam and lime.

[Chigs] It is the chocolate cream cheese

and it's not runny,
which I'm really cool about.

So these are amarena, black sour cherries.
They're very flavoursome and powerful,

so if you put too many,

you might end up pushing
the balance of flavour a bit too far.

[Crystelle] Cake number two.

[JÃ¼rgen] This is whiskey and apricot.

Look at you go!

Whoops. Sorry.

No, it's all right.
I'm-- It's very refreshing.

It's not the worst thing
to be sploshed on.

No. No, I can definitely
think of worse things.

-Yeah?
-Yeah.

[Crystelle] Right.
I need to decorate the hell out of it,

which is going to take me about ten years.

[Giuseppe] It's going to be all covered up
in mirror glaze.

[Lizzie] I want to see loads of colour.

And then, like, very textured.

I love a good rose.

[Giuseppe] This is going to be
a messy exercise.

[chuckles] It is very satisfying,
isn't it?

[Chigs] So, this is the ganache
for the chocolate drips

on the bottom layer.

[Lizzie] It's all the things
going on in me brain.

Some people think, ADHD,

you gotta be crazy,
you know, loads of energy,

but it's like you've got
too many thoughts in your head

and you don't actually know
what to think about.

So it's all about colour
and, you know, like brain fuzz.

[Noel] Looks like a tricky stage.

Better for my presence.

Absolutely.

You might not believe it,
but you are a calming influence.

That's never been said before.

[Lizzie] Oh, that's a bit wonky, isn't it?

-And this is the second tier.
-Oh, it's the second-- Wow.

How big is your cake?

-It's big.
-[Noel] Big.

You can get inside it?

-Ah, not quite.
-[Noel] You're gonna ride it in?

Oh, I'm not gonna talk now,

'cause I don't wanna get blamed
for that when that goesâ¦ [laughing]

This is stressful territory,
but I'm just gonnaâ¦ Oops.

â¦go on as quick as I can.

Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

I feel like I need to hurry up a bit.

Wow. I'm feeling so nervous.

What's wrong with me? Stop it.

Pipe faster.

[Crystelle] Right.
So, that's the bodice.

[Chigs] This chocolate is for the colour.

That will get wrapped
around the top layer of the cake.

I have to tidy up the edges
with lots of Chantilly cream.

[JÃ¼rgen] You understand
why you see me move very fast?

Yeah? I'm on track.

[Crystelle] My grandma,

she hasn't had
many opportunities to wear a nice dress.

So I think this will be almost like
the dress that she never got to wear.

[Lizzie] Do you think
this counts as finesse?

[JÃ¼rgen] So, I need the ganache
to run down the sides of the cake.

[Chigs] Nerve-wracking bit now.

[Crystelle] Shall I just move it
from A to B? I'm gonna have to.

There's a breeze. I'll wait for it to go

because it's gonna
knock over my cake, I can just feel it.

[JÃ¼rgen] How much time left?

Bakers, you have one minute left.

[Chigs] Oh, come on.

-I've gotta peel this off now.
-[Crystelle] The breeze is still there.

Unfortunately, I can't move
until that breeze has gone.

Gotta put
the decorating strawberries on top.

Finished in a hurry, huh?

We are staying very still.

Bakers, your time is up.

Done. Drop mic.

Please step away from your bakes.

[sighs in relief]

I feel like I've done
a gymnastics routine.

[Chigs] It looks unbelievable.
Look how neat that is.

It's supposed to be my grandma's dress.

What! Your grandma's
got a dress like that?

-Well, not thatâ¦ [laughing]
-Go on, Gran.

Well done, everybody.

[Lizzie] Who thought I could decorate
a cake like that? [laughs]

God, I'm getting emotional.
I'm so bloody proud of you.

-[Lizzie] Don't start crying, I'll cry.
-[Crystelle] I'm not gonna cry.

-I will cry. [sighs]
-[Chigs] Oh, bless you.

[Noel] After four hours
making gluten-free celebration cakes

with a place in the semi finals at stake,

the bakers now face the judgment
of Paul and Prue.

Crystelle, would you like to bring
your Showstopper up here?

[murmuring nervously] Gotta go for it.

Try not to walk like an idiot.

[Paul] It's a great-looking cake.

[Prue chuckles] It's quite witty, too.
I like the little bodice.

-Thank you.
-[Prue] Shall we see inside?

[Paul] Love the roses.

-Think you've done a great job with that.
-Thank you.

[Prue] Mmm. I love the texture.

-It's quite nutty and moist.
-Mmm-hmm.

[Paul] You wouldn't know
it's a gluten-free cake at all.

[Prue] No. The bake is beautiful.

It's the whole coating and the icing
go beautifully with the sponge.

If I have one criticism,

I think that it's very heavy
on the buttercream.

[Paul] But you need that
against the cardamom.

[Prue] If you get
a mouthful like thatâ¦ [chuckles]

Oh, I don't know, I like that.

-[all laughing]
-You'd be perfectly happy with it.

[Paul] I think you've done a great job.

-Well done. Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

[Prue] Very neat. Very beautiful.

[whispering] I don't know.

It's the top, it's just
a little bit awkward for me.

It hides a lot when you pipe like this.

Oh, okay.

My cake is inspired to the flavours
of the Black Forest,

that is, cherry, chocolate and, uh, cream.

It's actually a bit gluey.

Kirsch and the cherries are very strong.

[Paul] The cherries are pretty sporadic.

The sponge is quite stodgy.

-Is this a Chantilly?
-[Giuseppe] Yes.

I would have done an Italian meringue.
That would've worked beautifully well.

Underwhelmed.

-[Prue] Mmm.
-Mmm.

I expected better from you.

I do think it looks great.

-Thank you.
-You got good drops

on your naked cake down at the bottom.

The colour's worked.
It's a nice job. It looks like a crown.

There's a lot of detail in it.
It's really impressive, isn't it?

[Paul] Let's see if we can chop
into this bad boy, shall we?

[Prue] The layers are lovely and distinct.

-I love it.
-[chuckles]

It's spot-on.
It's a great chocolate sponge.

And, actually, you've got
a lot of buttercream in there.

-[Prue] Mmm.
-But it works.

Cream-cheese frosting again,
that's, like, cooling on the tongue.

That's a nice cake.

I can't fault it. I think it's lovely.

-Thank you.
-[Paul] Great job, Chigs.

-Thank you very much.
-Well done.

Who knew right at the beginning

that you could produce that
in the quarter finals?

I know. Thank you very much.
Appreciate it.

I would have never known
that was a chocolate cake.

[Prue laughs]

I think it looks absolutely beautiful.

[Paul] The whole effect
with the drips you've got

are all perfect and so is the piping.

-[Prue] Oh, that looks so beautiful.
-[Noel] Wow!

That apricot with the chocolate sponges

is beautiful. It's really nicely baked.

-It's not dry at all.
-[JÃ¼rgen] Mmm-Hmm.

I also think the buttercream
is beautifully light.

-Thank you very much.
-[Paul] Well done.

-[Matt] Well done.
-[Noel] Well done, JÃ¼rgs.

-[Paul] Matches his T-shirt.
-[Prue] Yeah. [chuckling]

-[laughing]
-[Prue] Ombre T-shirt.

[sighs, whispering]
Well done. Really good.

This is my celebration of being different.

I mean, that is just amazing.

And the rice paper offshoots
are just so beautifully done.

Look at the tiny little
letters and numbers.

I love it. It reminds me of something
from the cartoon The Yellow Submarine.

I've never seen a cake like it.
I don't think any of us have.

So, it's a lime Swiss meringue
and a coconut cake with pineapple jam.

You really need to eat
the buttercream with it

because the pineapple is very strong
and there's a lot of it.

I do get a hint of the lime.
And you need that in there.

You've got the coconut
in the sponge as well,

which you can taste.

-[Prue] Yes, the coconut's good.
-And you've got the pineapple.

I'd have that on my 40th any day.

When it eventually comes round.

-[laughing]
-[Lizzie] Okay. [chuckles]

-[Prue] I think it's wonderful.
-We asked for exquisite and finesse.

And we got it.

I knew you could do it.

-[Paul] Thank you.
-Ta.

[Matt] Well done.

It's just fantastic.

-[mouthing] Oh, my God!
-[mouthing] I know.

Oh, my God. Finesse!

I got finesse.

I've won Bake Off in my mind.

[Chigs] I don't know how I'm doing this.

Paul's comment was
that he couldn't fault it.

So, really overwhelming.

Happy, really happy.

Mine was a bit of a disaster. [chuckles]

I think that puts me,
you know, in an awkward position,

despite having done quite well yesterday.

I'm not sure what to expect, to be honest.

[Crystelle] I'm very happy that went well,
but I don't feel safe at all.

I'll cross my fingers, my toes,
say a prayer.

And, hopefully, my grandma,
who I dedicated my cake to,

is saying a prayer for me, too.

Wow. The world has turned upside down.

Four extraordinary Showstoppers
and Giuseppe didn't really impress you.

-The middle was no good at all.
-[Paul] It was stodgy.

But I think, ultimately,
Giuseppe was in a strong position anyway.

Giuseppe had done enough prior
to these two challenges to save himself.

-Yeah. I think Giuseppe's safe.
-What about JÃ¼rgen?

Those layers of the white,
milk and dark chocolate.

-Clever.
-And they were beautifully done.

-It was a delicious cake.
-So he's gotta be in line for Star Baker.

Absolutely. And I think JÃ¼rgen stepped up,
but he's not the only one.

Chigs. The cream cheese frosting,
the buttercream,

the sponge itself.

-Beautiful.
-[Prue] This was a faultless cake.

Well, let's talk about Lizzie's.

She made a cake and a pet
at the same time.

The time she spent, you know,
creating that bear rug,

we all knew she could come up
with something with finesse.

-I think she's done it.
-It's a complete triumph.

Now, Crystelle came into today in trouble.

Did she do enough with her Showstopper?

Problem is,
everybody else has done the same.

They've all done really well.

But Crystelle and Lizzie
are absolutely neck and neck.

I think you've got to look at it,
generally, as bakers,

which one deserves their place
in the semi final?

Well, bakers, you have made the judges'
lives quite difficult this week

because all five of you
are terrific bakers

and all five of you have had moments
of real excellence in the tent this week.

But we do have to separate you.

And I'm lucky in that
I have the job of telling you

which one of you
is going to be Star Baker.

I'm delighted to say
that Star Baker this week isâ¦

Chigs.

-Well done.
-[Crystelle] Well done!

I've got the horrible job of announcing
the person who's going home.

And, as Matt said, it was so close.

You've all been so fantastic.

The person who's leaving us isâ¦

Lizzie.

[voice breaking] No. No. No. No.
No, no, no, no, no, no!

[Crystelle sobbing]

[both sobbing]

I feel really proud of myself.
I'm really happy. Oh, God. [chuckles]

I was so overwhelmed to even get here
and now I'm, like, a quarter finalist.

And now I'm dead Scouse 'cause I'm crying.

-[Crystelle] Bloody Technical Challenges.
-You were so good.

Thanks. Oh, God. [chuckles]

[Lizzie] It's such an amazing experience,

oh, to, like, meet the people
that I've met and, like,

learn everything.

[sighs]

[Paul] You did really well.

It's really sad to see Lizzie go,
someone from my neck of the woods.

She's been a bit up and down
over the weeks,

but, actually, this week,
she did really well.

The problem was she came up with an ace
when everybody else did as well.

I am proud of myself.
It's, like, happy tears.

I can't wait to go and walk my dog,
to be honest.

[all laughing]

[Chigs] I can't believe
I got a Star Baker.

Getting one was brilliant,
but getting two? Wow!

It feels good

and I just get more
and more confident week on week.

[Crystelle] Semi final
of The Great British Bake Off.

I don't think
it's going to sink in for a while.

[sighs]

Semi finals! [laughing]

[closing theme music playing]

-Boo!
-[exclaims]

[chuckles] Hello, Freddie Mercury!

[chuckles] Hello, David Bowie
or Bow-wee or--

-Either's fine. I never knew myself.
-Hmm.

You come down for the show?

Yeah, yeah,
I come every year as it goes, yeah.

It's nice being a ghost,

'cause you don't have to wait for it
to come on TV.

You can be invisible, go in the tent
and watch it as it happens.

Exactly. And if you want to
get involved, just knock a cake over.

[chuckles] Bit of fun.



-You do that?
-Do you remember Sura?

-Oh, last year, with Dave?
-Yeah, that was me.

-[chuckling]
-Oh, very good! Very good.

-Hello, Elvis Presley.
-All right, guys?

-Have I missed anything?
-[Noel] No, it's about to start.

Oh, hello, Buddy Holly.

I'm Prue Leith.

Oh, sorry, you look just like
my mate Buddy Holly.

Stop messing about, boys,
and start the show.

Sorry, Buddy. I mean, Prue.

[all] Welcome to
The Great British Baking Show.

Hey-o!

[Matt] This timeâ¦

-[exclaims]
-â¦with places in the final up for grabsâ¦



You want this so bad
it's eating you up inside.

[Matt] â¦the bakers must produce
impeccable patisserieâ¦

We're certainly stepping outside
of the home-baking skills.

â¦with a multi-layered Signatureâ¦

[Crystelle] Oh, God! I feel like
I'm giving birth. [laughs]

â¦a fiendishly French Technicalâ¦

I ain't got a clue what's going on.

â¦and an epic five-hour Showstopperâ¦

[Chigs exclaims]

â¦that pushes the bakersâ¦

God, please don't fall.

[Chigs] Let's see how it fits.

â¦to breaking point.

[Chigs grunts in frustration]

Oh, my Lord! I don't think I can take
much more of this.

[opening theme music playing]

[Crystelle chuckling]

Clearly, the least capable baker.

Most likely to go out this week,
patisserie's not really my thing.

But enough of the negativity.

I just need to enjoy it,
'cause the worst that could happen is

I go out as a semi-finalist
and that's not too shabby.

-It's nice and quiet.
-Yeah, I know. [chuckles]

Eerily quiet.

[Giuseppe] I'm not surprised
I'm standing here.

I'm shocked
that I'm standing here. [chuckles]

I had to buy new clothes

because I didn't expect
to make it this far.

Of course it would be extremely exciting
to be in the final.

Patisserie Week. The tasting grade
should play to my strengths.

The "looking" grade, that's where
I need to hone my skills.

[Chigs] This week,
I do feel a bit out my depth.

[exhales]

In the practice tent, I made the mistake
of looking at the others' bakes.

It was like,
"Oops, what have I got myself into?"

Hello, bakers. Welcome back to the tent,

and congratulations
for reaching the semi-final.

For your semi-final Signature Challenge,

the judges would like you to bake
eight patisserie-style layered slices.

Your layered slices need to be identical,

and, when cut into,
they should hold their form,

displaying those beautiful layers.

The judges will be looking for
technically flawless, high-end bakes.

Basically, you just have to make
Pat Isserie very proud.

[Matt] Who's Pat Isserie?

He's a plumber from Bolton.
He loves this show.

[Matt] Oh, that's nice!

Hi, Pat, if you're watching.

You have three hours.

-On your marks.
-Get set.

[sing-song] Bake!

[Giuseppe] The judges are expecting
flawless, patisserie-style slices.

They must have been looking for words
that would scare the hell out of us.

[Chigs] You can't afford to make
any mistakes in any part,

and I make a lot of mistakes. [chuckles]

[Prue] I love Patisserie Week

because it gives the bakers a chance
to show how skilful they can be.

[JÃ¼rgen] Going on for the semi-final.

Going to measure ingredients precisely
and not lose track of what I'm doing.

We're asking
for eight identical layered slices.

I think there's going
to be nine layers in total.

We want those lines to be visible,
clear and absolutely impeccable.

This is all about finesse.
Exquisite flavours.

[Crystelle] This is my yuzu curd.

It's a kind of cross between
a grapefruit and a lemon.

It is a bit of a risk.

[Paul] The four bakers,
they've all had a handshake,

and they've all been
Star Baker at least once.

So, we do have the best of the best
in the tent at the moment.

-[Paul] Hello, Crystelle.
-[Crystelle] Good morning.

Crystelle, tell us about
your Signature slices.

It's got coconut
and black sesame dacquoise,

a yuzu curd,
black sesame and almond Joconde,

and a white chocolate and coconut
Italian meringue buttercream,

and those layers are repeated.

Then a layer
of white chocolate ganache

piped with whipped cream.

-Very simple.
-Very, very simple. [chuckles]

[Matt] Crystelle is going way beyond
the three layers demanded by the brief.

She'll use sesame to flavour
not just her four layers of sponge,

but a caramel brittle
that sits on piped Chantilly cream,

designed to help balance
the sharp yuzu curd.

[Noel] You're one step from the final.

You have to think about that

but you have to put that
right out of your mind.

I don't want to feel pressure.
I want to bake and enjoy it.

What else do you want? World peace?

-And a full-body massage.
-World peace, er,

-an end to the pandemic.
-[laughs]

That's an absolute lie.

You want this so bad,
it's eating you up inside.

-Wellâ¦ [laughs]
-Anyway, good luck. Bye-bye.

[Matt] All of the bakers are including
a whisked sponge called a Joconde.

[Chigs] A Joconde is just
with egg whites and a bit of fat.

And some sort of nut put through it,
so you could have almond or pistachio.

[Crystelle] There is no leavening agent,

so you wanna make sure you put enough air
into both your whites and your yolks.

[Giuseppe] This looks perfect to me.

[Chigs] This now has
the flour and almonds.

You just want to be gentle, but quick.

If you're too rough, it won't rise,
'cause you knock all the air out.

This is going in the oven immediately.

[JÃ¼rgen] It's a very thin sponge,
so it cooks very quickly.

[oven beeps]

And in my notes it says, "Watch."

Big mistake! Big mistake!

Big mistake!

[utensil clattering]

-Giuseppe, good morning.
-Good morning, guys.

[Paul] What have you done here?

I just put my batter
into the oven for baking,

and realised the flour is here. [chuckles]

-[both chuckling]
-Well, at least you realised before.

-Phew!
-Tell us all about your layered slice.

My layered slice

is inspired to a quintessential
Italian cake which is tiramisu.

Bravo!

[Matt] Giuseppe's giving his tiramisu
slice a twist with a layer of sultanas

stewed in Marsala wine between
the traditional coffee-soaked sponges,

and mascarpone pÃ¢tÃ© Ã  bombe.

He'll be hoping no other
ingredients are forgotten.

[exclaims]

How can you possibly forget
to add flour to your batter?

This is the tension playing tricks on me.

[Matt] At least Giuseppe only has
one sponge to contend with.

I'm toasting my desiccated coconut
before I add it to my dacquoise.

[Matt] Crystelle
is making life doubly difficult,

incorporating a second baked layer
to her slices.

Once I've got the baked elements
and the buttercreams and curds done,

it's then a case of assembly.

Now, I'm doing a billion things at once.

Happens to me all the time, man.

[JÃ¼rgen] You're coming out.

Good texture.

[Chigs] Five more minutes.
I'm gonna overbake it a bit

because I'm gonna soak it in syrup,
so it can hold its integrity.

I am making
a raspberry and chocolate slice.

I want to make sure the flavour
of the raspberry comes across

more than the chocolate,
'cause chocolate can be overpowering,

but I want that raspberry
to punch them round the face.

[Noel] With a slender layer
of chocolate ganache

sandwiched between Joconde sponges,

supporting a raspberry mousse,
thin coating of raspberry jelly,

and delicate decorations,

Chigs' slices will be the epitome
of Parisian elegance.

Over the weeks,
you've got better in your finesse.

-This should play to your new strengths--
-Fingers crossed.

If you want to get through to the final,
only one person can do that.

Just me. I know.

-Good luck.
-Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.

-Good luck.
-Cheers, Matt.

That meant a lot, that they've
noticed my finishing is getting better.

But the pressure's there definitely now.

I can't get him saying that, and then me
make an absolute mess of this.

[JÃ¼rgen grunts] It's called
"Murder at the Opera."

A variation of the opera cake.

[Matt] Chigs isn't the only baker
with a blood-red theme to his slices.

[JÃ¼rgen] My wife came up with the name.

She tasted the beetroot,
thought it was crazy,

er, but then really liked it.

[Matt] JÃ¼rgen's opera cake-style slices
will feature two buttercreams,

beetroot and cassis,

separated by coffee liqueur-soaked
Joconde layers,

coated in a chocolate glaze
and pierced by tuile daggers.

[JÃ¼rgen] I like the opera.
Probably my most favourite

is Alban Berg's Wozzeck
because it's multi-layered.

It has a lot of hidden things,
bit like my bakes. [laughs]

[Crystelle] Gonna take out these bad boys.

It's got a nice crust, which is good
because it will stop it from going soggy.

-[Giuseppe exhales]
-Gonna get my mousse on the go.

How long we got left now?

[Noel] Hey, Matt.
Can my friend do the time call?

-Sure.
-Introducing Sharky Sharkerson.

You ready, Sharky?
This is your big moment.

They'll do what you gotta say, go!

[Matt mimicking Sharky] Hello, bakers.
You're halfway through the challenge.

By the way, I'd like to say,
sharks get a very bad rap.

[Noel] All right, that's enough.

Unbelievable. I told him to
stick to the script and project.

Bakers, you're halfway through.

[Matt] In classic patisserie style,

the judges are expecting silky-smooth
soft-set elements

to complement the sponge layers.

My meringue is turning into
meringue buttercream,

'cause I'm throwing in
lots and lots of butter.

[Matt] Three of the bakers are making
meringue-based creamsâ¦

A pÃ¢tÃ© Ã  bombe is Italian meringue
made with yolks rather than whites.

[Matt] â¦that require heating
to pasteurise the eggs.

-How do you know when that's done?
-When it's at 60 degrees.

-[mixer whirring]
-Forty-five.

Fifteen to go!

This is television.

[Matt] It's a time-consuming step
that Chigs has decided to avoid.

[Chigs] In the mousse, I've got
raspberry puree, sugar and gelatin leaves,

and whipping cream.

[Matt] And he's already started
constructing his layers.

[Chigs] It'll go in the freezer
for the initial chill. I'll take it out,

put my jelly on it, leave it in
the fridge for half an hour, 40 minutes.

De-mould it, cut it, decorate it.

That's it. Finished.

That's gonna go in the freezer now.

-Fifty-two, 53--
-[groans]

Excruciating.

[Giuseppe] I'm blending
the mascarpone cream

into the pÃ¢tÃ© Ã  bombe.

I feel like we did that together.
I hope we get to the final.

-Yes.
-We're now a baking duo, right?

-We're a baking duo, yes.
-[Noel] Like Batman and Robin.

I feel like you're Batman
and I'm definitely Robin.

[chuckles]

Yeah, that's good.

I'm dividing up the buttercream
to flavour it.

Beetroot pulp.

I'm murdering my buttercream.

[Giuseppe] Time is getting tight.

The cooling down of the elements
is holding me back.

-[Matt] What's going on in there?
-That is sultanas drying out.

It doesn't look appealing at the moment.

Yes, a bit like a poo-ey porridge
at the moment.

[chuckles] I didn't
want to say that butâ¦

-Well, I didn't.
-â¦that''s-- Oh, okay.

[Noel] While the rest of the bakers
start to assemble their layersâ¦

[Crystelle] Oh, God!

â¦Chigs is already working
on his finishing touches.

That's about a millimetre,
maybe two millimetres, of jelly,

so that should set pretty quickly.

I'm not gonna lie,
I will be gutted if I got kicked out now.

If it's rubbery,
or the ganache is too thick,

the sponge isn't cooked properly,
then you're out, pretty much.

Bakers, you have half an hour left.

-[Giuseppe] You're done?
-[Chigs] I've got to decorate it.

-I have to wait for this.
-How long is the chilling time?

[breathes deeply] As long as I can get.

[Crystelle] Just need to be careful here.

Yeah, boy.

Right. Freezer.

The sultanas are not as cold
as I'd like them to be.

But I can't wait.

It smells really good.
I'm looking forward to try this one.

[Crystelle] These are
the little decorations to go on top.

Caramel and sesame seeds.

[Noel] It's ridiculous when you think
about this in the cold light of day.

A man making chocolate triangles

to impress an orange man
with very blue eyes.

-Think about that, let that sink in.
-[grunts] Fair enough.

[laughs]

[JÃ¼rgen] This is tuile paste.

We don't know what the murder is,

we just have the evidence
as blood and dagger.

I'm gonna need ten minutes
to do the final assembly,

so can you give me the ten minutes call?

[JÃ¼rgen] Going in.

And I really have to watch that.
It's so easy to burn.

I wanna get it out.

Bakers, you have ten minutes left.

This is very close.

[Matt] The bakers have been told
to ensure their slices are identical.

[Chigs] Going well so far.

I think that one's going
well-er than that one.

Yeah, this bit hereâ¦
These are the things they'll pick up on.

It's making me angry thinking
about them picking up on that.

If they do pick up on that,
I'll sweep Paul's legs.

-Like I'm in Cobra Kai.
-[laughs]

[Crystelle] It's cutting okay.

Oh, God! I feel like I'm giving birth.

Sorry, not that I've ever done
that before. [laughs]

[gasps]

Now is the main bit, just wanna make sure
they're all the same size.

[Crystelle] Commit to the cut.

Oh, yes.

Come on, cack-handed Lil, you can do this.

[chuckles]

[Chigs] Look at that one.
That's a good one, innit? [chuckles]

[Giuseppe] This should be fine.
I'm shaking.

You have one minute left!

[Chigs] I can't stop shaking.

It should go like that.

[Chigs exclaims]

[JÃ¼rgen] The buttercream
isn't as set as I wanted.

And they're not exactly the same size.

The more I look at them,
the more I'm not happy with them.

Neat enough, I think. [chuckles]

Bakers, your time is up!

Yeah, just a second.

Please place your slices
at the end of your stations.

-[exhales]
-[chuckling] You all right?

Mamma mia!

[Matt] The bakers' layered slices
are ready to be judged

by Prue and Paul.

-Chigs.
-Hi.

-[Prue] It looks good, Chigs.
-[Chigs] Thank you.

I like them a lot. You've managed
to create nice, sharp lines.

-Very Parisian.
-[Prue] Making my mouth water.

Erm, I like the sponge in there.
The sponge is good.

I think you've got just enough chocolate
there to marry it with the raspberry.

-Mmm.
-[Chigs] Are you serious?

-[Paul] Absolutely.
-[bakers clapping]

[Chigs] Thank you.

[Prue] I was a bit nervous
because that chocolate is quite strong.

Then I took it with the raspberry,
and it's perfect.

-[Paul] Yeah.
-So, that was all right, then.

-Well done.
-Thank you very much.

-Thank you, Chigs.
-Thank you, guys.

-[whispering] Not bad.
-[Chigs] Thank you.

Very nice, JÃ¼rgen.
The layers look stark, sharp.

The daggers make it,

'cause it does look very different
from a traditional opera cake.

[Prue] Thank you.

I think that's sensational.

-Thank you.
-The textures are absolutely perfect.

I like it, but I don't love it.

The flavour I do get is coffee.
And a bit of chocolate.

I cannot taste anything else.

Beetroot will bring colour and sweetness,
but it won't bring flavour.

Textures are spot-on, though,
I'll give you that.

Pity I'm not the one
who hands out handshakes.

-Thank you.
-I'll give you two.

[Prue] They're very unusual.

Really striking.

-[Noel] Exotic caterpillar colours.
-That's exactly what I was going for.

-[chuckles]
-[Noel] I hope so.

It's quite an unusual texture
because the dacquoise is really chewy.

[Paul] Yuzu is such a beautiful flavour.

But then you're left with the sesame

and that gorgeous texture of the creams
and the sponges going through there.

Oh, my God. [exclaims]

-Well done.
-[bakers clapping]

[Prue] Crystelle, that's absolutely
deserved because it's very striking.

It's absolutely delicious.
It's a little bit of genius.

[Paul] I've never had
anything like that before.

-Well done.
-Thank you so much.

-Thank you.
-Well done.

-What's happening to my life?
-You haven't woken up yet.

-This is a dream.
-[Crystelle] Yeah. [sighs]

It's really very elegant,
and looks very stylish.

Because the Joconde is soaked,
it's so soft.

-It's just delicious.
-It is.

[Prue laughing]

-How annoying is that?
-[contestants applaud]

The masala wine in there,

and the stewed sultanas
gives that little bit of body to it.

Sorry, I don't understand
anything you're saying.

-I'm just trying to fight backâ¦
-[all laughing]

I don't think I've ever had an afternoon
in the tent as satisfactory as this one.

-Wow.
-[Noel] Three handshakes!

-Excellent.
-You're gonna have to retire. [chuckles]

-Well done, mate. Amazing.
-Thank you.

-[Paul] Sorry, JÃ¼rgen.
-You got a handshake from me, all right?

I'd have given you one.

Okay.

[Giuseppe] Going from, "My slices
don't look as polished

as I would have liked them to be,"

to handshake, I was ecstatic.

[Crystelle] Well,
when he took out his hand,

I just thought of my family
jumping for joy

because I literally told them yesterday,
"This isn't going to be my week."

And they went, "Crystelle, be positive."

So I'm kind of being positive
for them, really.

And I'm really happy.
As a collective, we've done really well.

[Chigs] Don't mean nothing today,
handshake don't mean anything.

Just giving them out willy-nilly.

[JÃ¼rgen] There were three handshakes
in the tent. I didn't get one.

The judges were divided.

Bottom line, I'm in trouble now.

[Matt] For the bakers, the pressure
of Patisserie Week is about to rise

as they face their toughest Technical yet.

[Noel] Hello, bakers.
Welcome back to the tent.

It's time for your Technical Challenge,

which today has been set for you
by the adorable Prue.

-Prue, ay words of wisdom?
-Yes. Use your time wisely.

And remember that setting and chilling
are really important.

As ever, the Technical Challenge
will be judged blind.

So we're gonna have to ask
these two to leave the tent.

Bye-bye.

Where do you think they're going?

[Noel] Prue's taking Paul to a safari park

so he can be released
back in with the gorillas.

Oh. Yes, I heard about
the new silverback breeding programme.

That's great.

Now, for your Technical Challenge,

Prue would love you
to make a sablÃ© breton tart.

Your tart should consist
of a sablÃ© breton pastry

topped with raspberry confiture
and piped pistachio crÃ¨me mousseline.

It must be filled with fresh berries

and decorated with gilded meringue kisses
and chocolate curls.

[Matt] You have two hours and 45 minutes.

On your marks.

-Get set.
-Bake.

Ay, caramba. Look at all this stuff.

[JÃ¼rgen] I've heard of sablÃ© breton.

I think, essentially,
we know what we're doing.

I ain't got a clue what's going on.

I don't know anything they said
besides pistachio and fruit.

Semi finals, then, Prue,
and you've chosen a sablÃ© breton tart.

-It's quite complicated, isn't it?
-It is.

[Prue] They have to do
quite a lot of things.

They've got to make a sablÃ© breton bottom,

which is a very thick biscuit.

And then there's a thin layer
of raspberry confiture,

French for jam.

And then mousseline
flavoured with pistachio.

Then the raspberries and strawberries,

meringue kisses,
and curls of tempered chocolate.

So where could they go wrong with this?

They might not understand
that this thing doesn't have sides.

They just cut the pastry out,
plonk it in the tin to get that nice edge.

Right. That could catch them out.

And they have to watch
their setting and chilling.

That crÃ¨me mousseline
really has to be thick enough

not to run down the sides,
but soft enough to get the perfect shape.

It almost looks like a sponge.

[Paul] It does.

[Prue] It's buttery and light
like a shortbread.

-Not as sweet as a shortbread.
-No.

It's gorgeous.
The French know what they're doing.

-[Prue] I know.
-Aren't they annoying?

I do like the mousseline,
the texture's lovely, it's nice and light.

I'm not sure how the bakers
are going to deal with this.

From the sablÃ© to the mousseline,

will they be able
to get their timings right? I don't know.

But it is the semi final.
We know they're very good.

So, let's go and see.

So, I'm starting with the sablÃ© dough,
'cause that needs to chill.

The first step is,
"Whisk the egg yolks and caster sugar."

"Add softened butter,
and then the dry ingredients."

This is fancy butter,
it's Brittany butter.

I suppose that's what makes
this breton tart a breton tart.

I'm just adding the dry ingredients.

I think the key here
is just not to overwork the dough

like any shortcrust.

[JÃ¼rgen] I do it by hand
because I can be gentler than the machine.

I want to keep the dough very short.

[Chigs] That's the dough done, I think.

Now, it says "chill." I don't know
if I should freeze or fridge it.

I think I'm gonna put it in the fridge.
It says "chill," not freeze, soâ¦

-Okay. Oh.
-[tray clatters]

Right. That's step one done.

-[Noel] Hello.
-[JÃ¼rgen] Hi, Noel.

Well, I just thought that was wrong.

Everyone getting a handshake
except for JÃ¼rgy-pops.

But I feel like you're strong enoughâ¦

-I should be--
-â¦to rise from the ashes.

I should be able to.

[Noel] I just thought I'd check in,
see if you're all right.

You seem fine.

You're not going to get caught up
in all the hysteria, are you?

-[speaking indistinctly]
-It's not your style.

-You're the jazz baker.
-Hmm.

Just probably go back

and play some Miles Davis
on your trombone, right?

-Something like that.
-You, silhouetted against the moon--

-I'm gonna get some raspberries.
-Okay, bye-bye.

SablÃ© done. For meringue kisses,
make meringue.

Okay, so one medium egg white.

Probably should've used a smaller bowl.

[Crystelle chuckles]

How is this looking?

Still really runny.
I don't know if I'm doing this right.

[exclaims]

Looks done.

I might start again.

I just feel like that's not looking
like what a meringue should look like.

[Giuseppe] I'm making these very small,

'cause the smaller they are,
the quicker they will be to bake.

Is there a piping nozzle here?
Have they given us a nozzle?

Nope.

[Crystelle] This looks more like
the meringue we know and love.

[Chigs] Can't fit any more on.
Let's go.

These are gonna take about--

I don't know. I'll have to keep checking.

Okay, meringue kisses are done.
Right. Make the raspberry confiture.

Oh, it's a piping nozzle
to make the meringue kisses.

Now they're in the oven,
I can't do anything about it.

All right. Step number three,
we make the raspberry confiture.

Raspberry confiture.
Am I saying that right? "Confiture."

Raspberries, jam sugar and pectin.

That's just jam. Right?

Confiture is like a jam,
but it's got bits of fruit.

It's a bit more rustic.

Right, okay.
"Make pistachio paste and use--"

What?

"Use to make pistachio crÃ¨me mousseline."

CrÃ¨me mousselini. Right. Erm--

[JÃ¼rgen] CrÃ¨me mousseline is crÃ¨me pat,
with additional butter.

I've got my egg yolks,
flour and sugar here.

And I'm just tempering this
with vanilla-infused milk.

This is done.

While it's still warm,
I think I put the butter in.

Just going to make sure
that butter all melts into there.

-Hey, Matt, how's it going? Good?
-Good, thanks.

-How's it going for you?
-Yeah, all right.

I'm making some sort of crÃ¨me mousseline.

Named after the, er,
Italian dictator Mussolini.

But that's what I thought,
it was called crÃ¨me Mussolini.

-They said, "No, Chigs, that's wrong."
-Yeah.

How'd you feel about the handshake?

Yeah, it was good. I was happy. And then--

-[Matt] Everyone else got one.
-[Chigs] Crystelle got one.

And then he got one.

That's extraordinary. I don't think
that's ever happened in the tent.

-Never?
-I don't think so.

-I don't watch this show.
-[laughs]

I watch the other side.

[Chigs laughing] Good.

I'm assuming that's the right stage
to add the pistachio paste.

Now, it doesn't say how much to put in.

[JÃ¼rgen] I added my pistachios
to the crÃ¨me mousseline.

-That is looking good.
-[Chigs] Whack it all in.

They want pistachio taste,
I'll give them pistachio.

[Giuseppe] Looks good to me.
Certainly green.

Mmm, oh! Tastes really pistachio-y.

[Chigs] Just needs to chill now.
I'll pop this in the fridge.

Bakers, you are halfway through.

Approaching one hour

that the meringue kisses
have been in the oven.

Gonna take them out.

I don't want them to brown.
Ah, there we go. They're done.

[Giuseppe] They're perfectly baked.

They, er, look good.

It's not really French patisserie, is it,
that colour?

They're not supposed to be
brown like that.

-Oh, my God, look at JÃ¼rgen's. Perfect.
-[JÃ¼rgen] I'm happy with them. Next step.

"Roll and cut the sablÃ© dough
to fit the tin."

[Chigs] I'm assuming this dough
is gonna have to be really thin.

Just trying to gauge
if the tart needs sides.

It just says, "Roll out the sablÃ© dough
and fit it in the tin."

I just don't know if
it's supposed to be a sideless pastry.

I just don't know.

Do you go up the sides?
Or just put it in the bottom?

SablÃ© breton is usually baked
as a thick layer,

as far as I remember.

I'm not gonna do the sides.

I'm gonna roll it out
so it just fits the circle.

Right.

This dough melts literally in your hands.

Right. We're in.

[JÃ¼rgen] I expect that
to bake for 25 minutes.

I'm gonna say, this thickness,
about 20 minutes.

So I'm gonna be heating this
at least 20 minutes.

Okay, I hope
that was the right thing to do.

-But it's in now.
-[Chigs] What was I gonna do now?

Er, chocolate.

"For chocolate decorations,
using the acetate rectangles,

the long edge of the chocolate cone,

and narrow glass to make chocolate curls."

Oh, tempering chocolate.
I can do that that.

Right. That needs to melt.

This is the bit. This is the magic.
Watch this.

Little prayer to the chocolate god.

Please!

-And I'm not gonna touch it.
-Please make me good.

I don't want the wrath of Paul Hollywood.

Look at that. Boom.

-Well for now, so good so far.
-[Noel smacks lips]

Give me a shout
when you're gonna put that in there

'cause I want to see that.

-[Chigs] Come on.
-[Crystelle] That looks okay, actually.

-[Noel] What the hell?
-[Giuseppe] Look at that.

You were supposed to call me back.
We had a deal, an agreement.

-Sorry. I'm multitasking already.
-You forgot me, didn't you?

-What do you think?
-Yeah, I liked it.

But I'd have liked it more
if you'd have let me watch.

It's had 20 minutes. Yeah.

[Crystelle groans] Oh, man.

The sides have collapsed in.

Quite frankly,
that is not patisserie standard.

[JÃ¼rgen] I think it's looking good.

It needs to be golden,
like a nice shortbread.

Right. Do I stick this in the freezer?
'Cause it needs to chill.

I want to cool this very quickly

so that I can put the fillings
and the decorations on it.

Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

"To assemble, spread remaining
confiture over the sablÃ© baseâ¦"

"â¦leaving a one-centimetre pastry border."

[Giuseppe] This looks delicious.

[Chigs] Just a massive
Jammie Dodger, innit?

"Pipe the pistachio crÃ¨me mousseline
over the confiture and chill."

[Chigs] All right, I'm gonna wait
because this has not set yet.

[Giuseppe] Ooh. It's very thick.

[Crystelle] So I'm gonna do
just big fat stars.

[sighs]

[Giuseppe exclaims] Oh, careful.

Right. I need to chill this again.
How long do we have?

Bakers, you have five minutes left.

I don't think I have time.
I should just start assembling.

Now the question is,
should I go for a pattern?

I think it should be
a fairly random arrangement.

I'll go for a pattern.

My crÃ¨me pat's not setting.

I'll just put it on.
Nothing I can do about it.

[Chigs] Ah, I'm losing all the definition.
It's turning into liquid.

There you go. Now it's time to glaze this.

[Crystelle] Surely that's enough
strawberries for that tiny little tart.

Nah, it's just not set.

Everything's just oozing back out.
This needs to go in the fridge again.

[Giuseppe] Meringues. Let's get gilding.

[JÃ¼rgen] This is gold leaf.

[Chigs] Look, I'm shrinking.
Can you see I'm shrinking?

Oh, this is going from bad to worse.

Bakers, you have one minute left.

[Chigs laughing] It looks a mess.

I can do this. I can do this.

[Chigs] This doesn't
look like French patisserie.

Do I pipe more?
Maybe I'll just do a little.

Bakers, your time is up.

[sighs] That's it.

Oh, my God, I don't even think
my local corner shop would sell this.

Please bring your bakes to the table
and place them behind your photograph.

[Noel] Prue and Paul
are looking for patisserie perfection.

Each sablÃ© breton should have
a thick, crumbly base

topped with raspberry confiture

and beautifully set
pistachio crÃ¨me mousseline,

elegantly decorated with fruit,
gilded meringue kisses

and chocolate curls.

-They all look very different.
-Hmm.

This one looks pretty.

But the base is very, very thin.

-[Prue] Should be much thicker than that.
-Yeah.

[Prue] The baker's tried to make it
like a conventional tart.

-Not flat.
-Yeah.

Where's the rest of the
strawberries and raspberries?

It's a little bit dense on the biscuit,
but it does taste quite nice.

Moving on. From the mousseline upwards,
that looks good.

But that base is very, very thin.

[Prue] That looks a bit overbaked.

[Paul] Let's have a look.
I think it is slightly overbaked.

[Prue] Actually, it tastes quite good.

Everything else is good.
I'm just not happy with that biscuit.

The mousseline on this
is terrible on number three.

And those meringue kisses
are not well piped.

And that mousseline
has not set at all has it?

This is not a proper biscuit base,
it's a bit soft.

-Hmm. It's underbaked.
-Mmm.

[Prue] Not helped by very wet mousseline,
which will make it soggy anyway.

-[Paul] Hmm.
-[Prue] Okay.

This is very pretty.

And it has got small
little Italian kisses.

I'd like to see
more of a dome of the fruit.

And insideâ¦

very thin.

I think the baker's tried to make it
like a conventional flan.

-Flavour's good.
-[Paul] Hmm.

Okay.

[Matt] Prue and Paul will now rank
the sablÃ© breton from worst to best.

All right, in last place is this one.

Chigs, underbaked, mousseline is not set.

But besides that, it's fine.

Cheers.

In third place, we have this one.

Crystelle, the biscuit is a little thin,
but the flavour's nice.

In second, we have this one.

-Whose is this?
-That's me.

Giuseppe, the sablÃ© was far too thin,
but the overall appearance was quite nice.

Which means, JÃ¼rgen, the biscuit base
is a fraction overbaked,

-but otherwise it's a very good sablÃ©.
-[bakers clapping]

-Thank you.
-[Crystelle] Well done.

[JÃ¼rgen chuckling]

That went very well.

What a relief.

I certainly will sleep better tonight.

Second last is not great.

But I just didn't want to come last

because that would have put me
in a really scary position.

[Chigs] The Technical was a disaster.

That's probably my worst bake.

Out of the 26 bakes we've done,
that's my worst one.

Very, very happy.
Second position. Fantastic.

The first day was very positive,

which is a good position
to start the second day.

The Showstopper of patisserie
is very difficult.

Er, I expect a very tense day tomorrow.

[Chigs] I do better
with my back against the wall,

so I'll come out swinging tomorrow.

[Matt] There's just
the Showstopper Challenge left

before Prue and Paul will decide
who will be crowned Star Baker

and who'll miss out
on a place in the final.

[sighs] Okay.

Hello, bakers, welcome back to the tent.
It's time for your Showstopper Challenge.

Yes, the judges would like you to create
a spectacular themed banquet display,

comprising of at least
12 individual entremets desserts,

arranged around a beautifully
crafted edible centrepiece.

You have five hours
for your entremets desserts.

Minus the three and a half hours
that me and Matt come 'round

and witter in your ear
about any old nonsense.

-Yeah, sorry about that.
-[Noel] On your marks.

-Get set.
-Bake!

Getting into my zone.
Feeling confident to pull this off.

I'm ready to fight and do my best
and enjoy it, most importantly.

[Paul] It's Showstopper time,

and we've asked the bakers
to produce a themed entremet display.

Now, this is going to be

one of the most difficult challenges
they've ever done in the tent.

I didn't know
what a flipping entremet was.

[mumbles] entremet.
This is not normal stuff.

[Paul] An entremet is a delicate dessert.

It's layer upon layer
of beautiful textures and flavours.

What I'm looking for more than anything
is finesse.

When you cut into them, they must look
absolutely staggeringly pretty.

We're certainly stepping
outside of the home baking skills here.

It's very complex, gonna be a long day.

The bakers do have five hours,

but this is the semi finals
so we want to see what they can do.

The more skills they can show us
in this banquet display, the better.

Oh! Need to stop doing that to myself.

[Paul] There are a few bakers
fighting for their place in the final.

And I can't call who's gonna go through.

But it's gonna be interesting.

-[Paul] Giuseppe, hello.
-Buongiorno.

Tell us all about your entremet display.

So, my display's gonna be inspired

by a city that I've lived in
for about ten years in Tuscany.

That's Pisa.

So, the centrepiece is gonna be
a representation

that requires some imagination
of the Leaning Tower.

[Matt] Giuseppe
will fashion his leaning tower

from puffed rice and marshmallow

while his domed entremet will feature
a chocolate custard and cherry insert

surrounded by pine nut bavarois.

-That all sounds very Tuscan.
-It does. Sounds delicious.

-That was the plan.
-And have you practised this?

Er, if I'm honest, start to finish? No.

So if it comes out wonky,
I got a justification.

[all chuckling]

[JÃ¼rgen] Making a raspberry pulp.

This is the basis for my raspberry jelly
as well as the raspberry Bavarian.

[Noel] JÃ¼rgen, too, has been inspired
by his love of architecture.

My bake is the Torii gate in the sea.

It's a Japanese gate.

Typically, they are
at the entrance to Shinto temples.

And when I was young,
I got a children's, er, encyclopaedia.

One picture in there
that particularly fascinated me

was a picture
of this Japanese temple gate.

[Noel] JÃ¼rgen will construct
his Torii gate from gingerbread

whilst a fleet of Japanese entremets boats
will contain layers of genoise sponge,

raspberry jelly and no less
than three Bavarian creams,

white chocolate, raspberry and matcha.

I occasionally love matcha,
but mostly it's too strong for me.

It can be an acquired taste,

but I find when you activate the matcha,

you need to heat it to about
80 degrees in some liquid.

Does that make it milder?

It makes it milder.
It takes the grassy flavour away.

[Paul] Your flavour combinations
are normally very good.

It's a very original idea. Lovely.

-Thank you.
-Sounds amazing, good luck, JÃ¼rgen.

[Matt] At five hours,

this is the longest challenge
the bakers have faced so far.

I've got a lot to do today.

[Crystelle] Entremets are about
multitasking until you almost faint.

[JÃ¼rgen] I'm building
the Bavarian inserts.

The insert is the first thing
that I have to start making,

'cause that needs to freeze

before I can start
working on anything else around it.

-Next.
-Pine nut bavarois.

[Matt] Not only
must every flavour pack a punchâ¦

[Giuseppe] Roasting them
releases a lot of flavour.

This little bunch of pine nuts
is flavouring 12 entremets.

â¦they must also work together
in perfect harmony.

[JÃ¼rgen] This is matcha powder.

I need to make the matcha Bavarian.

Matcha flavour shouldn't be overly strong,

but it should balance
the tartness of the raspberries.

[Matt] But that's not all.

I've added four sheets of gelatin.

[Matt] When it comes to textures,
patisserie demands perfection.

[Giuseppe] The texture of Bavarois
is very difficult to get right

because it needs to be very soft.

But it's very easy
to overdo the gelatin element

and get it too thick and rubbery.

Okay.

[Matt] And, with a place
in the final at stakeâ¦

I am doing vanilla and coconut
cremeux centres.

â¦Crystelle's taking no chances.

When in practice I did them, they set,
but I was worried they set a bit too much.

I'm going to do
two almost-identical batches,

but one has just got
one less sheet of gelatin.

[Matt] Crystelle's vanilla
and coconut cremeux centres

will be encased by mango bavarois
and a punchy passion fruit jelly.

Her tropical entremets
will surround a wedding-themed centrepiece

dedicated to sister Chantelle,

whose nuptials
have been sadly paused by the pandemic.

-What are you making?
-This is a Swiss meringue.

I'm doing a little meringue flower arch.

-Real arch, can you get under it?
-Er, yeah.

-Can you limbo under it?
-If you limbo really far down.

You look like you're dressed to limbo.

Yeah, I actually once
won a limbo competition on holiday.

-I'm deadly serious. Of course I did.
-Of course you did.

I feel like I might have
limboed at a party

-and was quite good at it.
-Really?

We should do a limbo-off.

[chuckling] If you get-- If you get
to the final, we'll do a limbo-off.

Oh, well, that's not gonna happen.
I mean, yeah, yeah.

Deal.

-[Paul] Hi, Chigs.
-Hey, Paul. Hi.

[Matt] Crystelle's not the only baker

putting family at the heart
of their entremets display.

My Showstopper is called, "The Apple
Doesn't Fall Far from the Tree."

It's based around an apple tree
my grandparents had in their garden.

We used to play around it as kids.

So my centrepiece
is going to be in the shape of a tree.

[Matt] Nestled under
his cinnamon-biscuit apple tree,

Chigs' entremets will be filled
with a caramelised apple insert,

caramel and white chocolate mousse,

and coated in a dark chocolate shell
and shiny red mirror glaze.

This has never worked for me in practice.

Don't say that in front of the judges.

Why would you do it then?

It hasn't worked because when I set
the chocolate around it,

I put a stick in it to dip it.

When I take
the stick out, it always cracks.

So, today, I've never tried it,
I'm gonna use toothpicks instead.

-Good luck, Chigs.
-Thank you, guys.

Do some praying.

I love that you're living on the edge.

You have to!

I have practised it,
it's just something's always gone wrong.

Today is the day
I need to pull it out the bag.

Bakers, you are halfway through.

I feel like
my legs are getting longer, no?

No.

[Chigs] All the elements are done now.

I've gotta get
the entremets in the freezer,

setting for as long as they can

so they hold their shape
when I take them out of the moulds.

The Joconde sponge is ready.

[sighs] That was close.

Mango bavarois is here.
I'm gonna fill these.

Then put my cremeux inserts inside.

I put the apple pie insert in
and I'm topping up with some more mouse.

The cherry's a perfect colour for this.
It gives it a nice burst of flavour.

Just in the centre and it's very chewy.

The whole thing is very soft
so you need something with more bite.

[Crystelle] These seem
a little bit wobbly, but--

Oh! [gasps] They're set.

[JÃ¼rgen] This is genoise sponge.

I need to set the jelly
on top of this this sponge

before I can get the entremets built.

[Crystelle gasps] Freeze baby, freeze.

[JÃ¼rgen] Jelly's in.

-Right. Done.
-Biscuit.

Preparing the dough for my centrepiece.

It's gingerbread.
It is wonderful dough to work with.

[Chigs] This is a simple cinnamon biscuit.

I'm gonna bake it for a bit longer
so it's crispier and snappier as well.

I don't want it
to be like gingerbread, where it's soft.

[Noel] And while JÃ¼rgen's
intricate Japanese Temple gate

requires batch-baking
nearly 40 individual pieces of biscuitâ¦

[JÃ¼rgen] Going in for ten. [gasps]

I'll do this thing again.

â¦Chigs' time-saving tree designâ¦

-[Chigs] The template for the biscuit.
-â¦consists of just two pieces.

[Chigs] Twenty minutes.

[Noel] But Giuseppe
and Crystelle's centrepieceâ¦

I'm making my big edible wreath.

â¦requires no oven time at all.

This is puffed rice,
the bricks and mortar of my leaning tower.

[Crystelle] Puffed rice is very light,

so it's a good option
for constructing things.

It's not heavy, so it shouldn't collapse.

[Noel] With his first batch
of gingerbread in the oven

and jelly layers setâ¦

Okay, here we go.

â¦for JÃ¼rgen, entremet assembly
can finally begin.

I'm very slightly behind.

I need to get the entremets frozen,

otherwise they just stick
to the mould and crumble.

-What're you doing?
-Hello. I am smoothing down a candle.

So, how's your bake going?
Have these been baked yet?

They have been baked.

They're little doves which are going
to go on top of my entremets.

I'm just putting the candle in the hole.

-Ermâ¦
-So it's gone in the hole.

â¦and I'm just going to,
erm, smooth it down.

Oh, my Lord, I don't think
I can take much more of this.

Bakers, you have an hour left.

[Chigs] That's a good colour.
That's a great colour,

[JÃ¼rgen] Possibly a little bit overdone,
but better overdone in this one.

Nice and stable. That's the last lot.

Now I'm smoothing out the two logs.

This will be the main tower,
and that smaller one will be the top.

[Crystelle] This is Swiss meringue.

You put two different colours
in one piping bag

and out pops a little swirled beauty.

How are you, JÃ¼rgs? Nice colour.

-Wonderful, isn't it?
-[Noel] That is an intense red.

That's like hell.

Well, it's a gateway to something else.

-Gatewayâ¦
-[both] â¦to the final.

Is that what you're doing? Clever boy.

Might be. I don't want to put
the letters on the wall, so to speak.

I feel like you're building
your own metaphor.

[JÃ¼rgen] Indeed.

[Crystelle] If I overbake this,
this whole thing can crack.

So it's a very tricky thing
that I've decided to do for my structure.

[Chigs] We'll see how it fits.

Yeah, baby.

[screams] I hit it!

Don't worry, it's okay.
Just stick it together with icing.

I need to make sure the entremets set.
Need to take them out of the moulds.

They're completely frozen.
They're very well set, which is good.

They feel really soft,
and I don't know why,

but I'm just gonna have to go with it.
Oh, God.

Just stay calm Crystelle, stay calm.

[JÃ¼rgen] Okay.

Houston, we've got sails.

Assembly time, definitely.

This is isomalt.

I'm using it to stick
my Torii gate together.

[Crystelle] Doing a very abstract swirl.
Okay, I have to glaze my entremets.

[exhales] Breathe, woman. Okay.

Noel told me he thinks
you look like Robert De Niro.

-Can you do the impression?
-Which one?

[mimicking Robert De Niro]
You talking to me?

-Are you talking to me?
-Is that from Taxi Driver?

Yeah, that's Taxi Driver.

-Can you do that?
-I can't do the face.

-No.
-I can certainly do the--

-Yeah.
-Is it stuck?

Oh.

-Yeah. I'll go and getâ¦
-[Chigs] Get it sorted out.

-Cheers. Thank you.
-Good luck with your bake.

[Giuseppe] The thickness of the glaze
is just right to cover everything.

Now I'm gonna dunk.

It still ain't perfect,
but it's the best I've ever had it.

[JÃ¼rgen] Engineering begins.

[Giuseppe] Going over it more than once.

I'm ruining this, jeez.

This is not going well.

-JÃ¼rgen. You all good?
-[sighs]

One piece is missing.

I'm sure I cut it out.

[breathing heavily]
Without this piece, it won't go up.

How much time?

Bakers, you have
half of an entire hour left.

[JÃ¼rgen] Oh,
this is going to be super tight.

This is just madness.

Just suddenly realised I have a lot to do
and really not a lot of time.

-[JÃ¼rgen] Yes. I'm happy with those.
-I've gotta quickly make some apple stems.

[Crystelle] So I'm doing pine cones,
roses, leaves, made out of butter cream.

They're coming out.

[Noel] That is the missing bit
slotting right in now. Yeah?

-Yeah.
-Yes! JÃ¼rgen.

[Chigs] It's not red enough,
it's gonna be a Pink Lady.

[Crystelle] Breathe, breathe, breathe.

[Crystelle gasps] Oh, for God's sake, no.

[Chigs sighs in frustration]

[Crystelle]
This is gonna be so tight. [sighs]

[Giuseppe] Never underestimate
an Italian engineer.

When it comes to make wonky buildings,
we're always first in the game.

[gasps]

Oohâ¦

[JÃ¼rgen] Going in for the glaze.

[Crystelle] Please don't crack.

[JÃ¼rgen] Oh, come on.

[Crystelle] I don't think
that's gonna stay.

It's gonna have to stay.

[sighs] Oh, God, please don't fall,
please don't fall.

Bakers, you have one minute left.

[sing-song] This is getting tight.

[Crystelle] Come on.

[Chigs] Ah, it's breaking.

Weddings are goddamn stressful.
Maybe it's a sign I shouldn't get married.

[sighs] I'm proper shaking.

Bakers, your time is up.

Please step away from your bakes.

[JÃ¼rgen sighs]

[winces]

-Well done.
-[Noel] Well done, kids.

-[sighs]
-That was a monster challenge.

[Matt] That was epic.

Look at JÃ¼rgen's, it's unbelievable.

[Giuseppe] Does it surprise you?

That was the most intense thing.

[JÃ¼rgen] I just want to say
well done to you all.

Yeah, guys, well done.
Do you know what? I'm proud of us.

[all chuckling]

[Crystelle] Yeah.

[Matt] It's judgement time for the bakers'
showstopping entremets displays.

JÃ¼rgen, would you like to bring up
your Showstopper, please?

Love the gate. It's very authentic.

The colour of the entremets
don't really draw you in.

It's a bit bland.

[Prue] This shape is perfect
for those little Japanese boats,

but if you'd had time, you could have
piped some detail on them

or something to have
made them stand out a bit more.

Hmm.

That's very interesting.

Different layers of taste,
one after another.

[Paul] Your raspberry jelly's
got a nice kick to it.

And that matcha
is hidden by the raspberry.

There's still a hint,
but the raspberry comes through.

You didn't want it the other way,
it would've been dry on the palate.

-Thank you.
-Well done.

Well done, JÃ¼rgen.

Well done, JÃ¼rgen.

[JÃ¼rgen] Thank you.

Giuseppe, you said
you hadn't even practised this.

It's just amazing. It's leaning
more than the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

I think I made the leaning tower
wonkier than it is.

These look fairly straightforward
on the outside.

All the work, of course,
with an entremet, is on the inside.

-Yeah.
-[Paul] Oh, lovely.

-[Noel] Beautiful green.
-[Matt] Hmm.

[Prue] The bavarois is very delicious,

but the pine nut's
not coming through very well.

Oh, okay.

Without that cherry,
you really would be hunting for flavours.

Having said that,
all your textures are spot-on.

Thank you.

[Matt] Well done.

[Chigs] Well done, Giuseppe.

-It's very impressive.
-Thank you.

I'm knocked back by the purple colour.
They look more like a plums.

I should've put
more red colouring in the glaze.

-Pink ladies, that's what they are.
-Yeah, right.

I love that they're sitting on a biscuit.

And the biscuit looks well baked as well.

Hmm.

-It's exceptional.
-[chuckles nervously]

Your apple
has got a little tartness to it.

You can taste the caramel
in the bavarois as well.

And you have that slight
bitterness from the chocolate.

So you've got all the flavours
correctly balanced

to create an apple scene with the tree.

You've really been
on a journey, haven't you?

You started baking last year.

Look what you've done.
That is very, very, very good.

-[Chigs] Thank you, Paul.
-[Prue] Thanks, Chigs.

-Well done.
-Thank you very much.

[Noel] Well done, Chigs.

[Chigs exhales]

[Giuseppe, whispering]
Come on, you smashed it.

-That's stunning.
-[Prue] Love the colours.

If it was in the middle
of a wedding table,

all eyes would be upon it.

[Paul] What I'm interested in
is those entremets,

they look like works of arts.

[Prue] Mmm.

That, Crystelle, is flawless.

-[Paul] I don't know what I can say.
-It's just beautiful.

The passion fruit is really strong.
The mango much silkier. It is lovely.

-Absolutely lovely.
-Thank you. Sorry.

[Prue laughing]

-Thank you, Crystelle.
-Thank you so much.

[Matt] Well done.

Thank you so much.

[Crystelle] It's really emotional

because it always means more
to, erm, get good comments

on a bake that means a lot to you,
that's dedicated to someone. Erm,

[voice breaking]
so I'm just really proud of myself.

[sighs] I'm speechless at the moment

and a little taken aback
by the comments they've given me.

If I was to go out now,
I could walk out smiling.

I don't know how they're going to call it.

Yesterday, there were three handshakes
and I won the Technical.

And, today, all these
very positive comments.

There were four Star Bakers in there.

Simple as that.

[Giuseppe] We've become friends
over almost two months.

We are very proud of each other.

As a collective, we've done very well.

I don't know what's gonna happen.
It's a very, very close call.

[Matt] Wow. There are four really
impressive bakers in this tent.

I do not envy you the task
of having to separate them.

What's almost unique,
we're picking the worst of the best.

It really is difficult
because all of them tasted fantastic.

Crystelle.

Look at the layers in that.
The coconut biscuit.

-[Paul] The glaze is stunning.
-[Prue] Yes.

And Chigs, look
at the amount of skill in that.

There's a biscuit, a crumble.

There's a wonderful chocolate case,
which is not easy to do.

[Paul] JÃ¼rgen was clever
with the matcha and the raspberry.

-A bit boring to look at.
-And then you come down to Giuseppe.

My only complaint with this.

-I love the beautiful colour.
-So neat.

[Prue] And the cherry is fantastic.

My only complaint?
I couldn't taste the pine nut.

[Matt] So we're
in a very unusual position, where--

You could argue for any one of these.

This is the worst time to go home as well,
so it's horrible.

Yes, it is. It's really hard.

I don't know
how you're gonna make this decision.

[Noel] Ah, bakers,

this is such a precarious point
in the competition.

Obviously,
everyone wants to get to the final

and it's so close at this point,
it's just crazy.

I've got the amazing job
of announcing Star Baker.

The person who is Star Baker isâ¦

Crystelle.

[Crystelle gasps]

-Oh, my God.
-[Chigs] Why are you surprised?

Why are you so surprised?

-Oh, my God.
-[Chigs] You just smashed it.

[Matt] Okay.

I'm afraid to say

that the person who will not
be making it into the final,

and who will be going home isâ¦

JÃ¼rgen.

No.

[Crystelle] What?

[Giuseppe] What?

[Paul] Sorry, mate.

[JÃ¼rgen] I feel kind of okay,

Iâ¦ I kind of saw it coming.

[laughs]

I think the others
are more shocked than I am.

[Crystelle] Oh, my gosh.

JÃ¼rgen, you've been
an inspiration, really.

-Like one of the mostâ¦
-Oh, JÃ¼rgen.

â¦incredible bakers ever.

You were amazing.

[voice breaking] It's been incredible.

It's been an absolute pleasure
to have you with us here.

Really enjoyed being here.
I made friends for life.

And I will be with themâ¦

[chuckles] inâ¦ In spirit.

-See you in the final.
-[Crystelle] Thank you so much, Paul.

Ermâ¦

shell-shocked is an understatement.

Hi, Star Baker.

It's just, I don't think
it's really hit me, really. It's mad.

Star Baker in Patisserie Week.
I'm in the final.

[voice breaking] Just a lot of things
that don't make sense.

[Noel, whispering]
You're in the final. [laugh]

I ain't got a clue what I'm doing here.
How has that happened?

I'm so shocked. I don't know what to say.

I am now cacking it. [laughs nervously]

I am scared sockless.

But I'm really, really--

Happy's not the right word,
I'm over the moon.

I just want to make the best out of it
and have a jolly good time next week.

Hi, is everyone there?

-[woman] Yeah.
-Erm, not good news.

You're not gonna see me for
another week because I got Star Baker!

-[laughs]
-[woman screaming]

[screaming continues]

[sniffling] I know, guys,
I'm in the final. [laughs]

[closing theme music playing]

It's the final, and the remaining bakers are set three challenges that will test every aspect of their baking skills, including a classic carrot cake and a Mad Hatter's tea party banquet. One baker will be crowned the Bake Off 2021 winner.
[Matt] In the beginningâ¦

Good luck in there.

â¦there were 12.

-[laughing]
-Hello, Prue, how you doing?

[singing "Meet the Flintstones" in German]

I don't want to get emotional.

Everybody's terrified
about collapsing cakes.

-[crowd laughing]
-[gasps]

-[Matt] Oh, no!
-[Freya] Oh, my God.

-[Matt] Nowâ¦
-[Crystelle] Breathe.

Just remember to breathe.



â¦there are three.

-[Giuseppe] There's so much to do.
-Are you taking the mick?

[Crystelle] Do not drop.

-This is not going to be pretty.
-[Crystelle gasps]

Can't do anything now, can I?

[gasps] Oh, the oven is off.

What have you done?

[opening theme music playing]

[Noel] The 2021 final is like no other.

-Are you serious?
-Yeah, absolutely.

[Noel] For the first time ever,

each of our finalists
have won two Hollywood handshakesâ¦

Oh, my God!

â¦and also been
awarded Star Baker two times.



[Noel] Giuseppe.

[Noel] It's never been this close before.

-Giuseppe, congratulations.
-[all applauding]

[Matt] From the beginning,
Giuseppe's eye for elegant precisionâ¦

That looks as neat as a pin.

â¦and consistently stunning
Italian-influenced recipesâ¦

[Paul] You'd serve that in a decent hotel.

How many stars?

Oh, a good five.

â¦marked him out for greatness.

[Giuseppe] I don't have
any special strategy for the final.

I'm trying to leave it
as a standard baking day

with no extra pressure.
As far as I can, at least.

[Noel] Crystelle has delivered
some of this year's most beautiful bakes.

It's a great-looking cake.

[Noel] And coupled
with incredible flavours

from her Goan family recipe bookâ¦

I have to tell you it was delicious.

â¦she's peaked at precisely the right time.

-That, Crystelle, is flawless.
-[Matt gasps]

[Noel] But she's the only finalist
yet to win a Technical Challenge.

[Crystelle] Maybe today's the day
I nail a Technical Challenge.

There is no room for error.

Even if it's a case of, "You've just
overbeat your batter by, like, one fold."

[exhales]

[Matt] Chigs is one of the least
experienced bakers to ever reach a final.

-[chuckling] Compose myself.
-[Matt] But you wouldn't know it.

[Paul] Very clever.

[Matt] Learning more
with each passing weekâ¦

They're nearly perfect.

â¦his quarter and semi-final bakes

were among the best
in this year's competition.

It's exceptional.

You've really been
on a journey, haven't you?

[Chigs] I've been an underdog
throughout this whole thing.

In my opinion, that is.

It's imperative
to have a good start today

to build that confidence
and settle the nerves a little bit.

Congratulations, bakers.

You have made it to the final
of The Great British Baking show.

Today, for your
last-ever Signature Challenge,

Paul and Prue would love you to make
an exquisitely decorated carrot cake.

Your sponge should consist
of complementary flavours and textures

in the form of fillings and decorations.

Remember, it's not just Paul and Prue
you're trying to impress,

Bugs Bunny is going to
swing in later to be a guest judge.

He's on the way here now,
he's getting a lift from Yosemite Sam.

And there'll be all manner
of animated antics and hilarious mayhem.

You have two hours, 15 minutes,

[imitates Porky Pig]
and that's all, folks.

-[Matt] On your marks.
-[sing-song] Get set.

Bake!

I've got an enormous amount
of things to squish with in two hours.

I'm not thinking too much
about it being the final,

because I'll freak myself out.

I'm not a big fan of carrot cake,
but what can go wrong?

Anybody would think
a carrot cake is so simple and easy,

but we want something
really special and different.

We're looking for inventiveness.
We want carrot to be the hero,

but we want to see
other highly decorated elements

being added to it as well.

[Prue] Two and a quarter hours,
sounds a lot of time,

but the thing is, you cannot put
cream cheese frosting onto a warm cake.

Because the whole thing
would just slide and melt.

And it'll look a mess.

-[Paul] Morning, Giuseppe!
-Morning!

-Hello.
-Morning.

What are you going to be doing?

I'll be giving a Mediterranean-Italian
twist, for a change.

[all chuckle]

The key element
is going to be a fig jam with walnuts.

Lovely.

[Noel] Giuseppe's fig and walnut jam

will fill an orange zest-infused
carrot cake

decorated with a light
orange cream cheese icing,

candied walnuts and fresh figs.

[Paul] I love the idea of the figs.

That's going to be a nice hit on top
of a traditional carrot cake.

I like the idea of being
able to do all of this in two hours,

'cause there are a lot of baked elements
and I'll have to be very quick.

[Matt] Whilst Giuseppe is giving
his carrot cake a Mediterranean feel,

Crystelle is heading
a little further east.

[Crystelle] This is fresh cardamom.

You should get a hint of orange
from the orange curd,

then you taste the pistachio
and finally some cardamom on your tongue.

[Matt] Crystelle's richly spiced sponges

will form a towering
four-layered carrot cake

decorated with a pistachio
and mascarpone icing.

It's only carrot cake,
what could go wrong?

-What could go wrong?
-Stop it.

-Because when you say thatâ¦
-This what you make when you're six.

-Erâ¦
-Carrot cake.

-Yeah.
-Lots of kids hate carrot cake.

"Do you want chocolate or carrot cake?"

-Yeah. True.
-No kid says carrot cake.

If my kid says carrot cake,
I'll push them into a ditch.

-Stop it.
-[Noel] Chocolate.

You can't say that about your kids.

They won't say it. They're cool.
"I want chocolate, double chocolate."

"I want all the stuff
I'm not allowed to have."

-Fair enough.
-No children go,

"I'd quite like loganberry
and carrot, please."

[both laugh]

[Noel] With Crystelle and Giuseppe
attempting to add their own twist

to the classic carrot cake,

Chigs is also trying something new.

This is the second time
I'm making carrot cake.

[Noel] For his first-ever
carrot cake recipe,

Chigs is adding
a star anise-infused pineapple jam

and will decorate with yet another first.

I saw something on YouTube

on how to make these look like
really tiny, itty-bitty carrots.

How much carrots
have got in the actual batter?

Nine-hundred grams.

-In the batter?
-In the batter.

-That's a lot.
-It's a lot.

-Yeah.
-I want its flavour to come through.

Four-forty grams.

[Matt] The sooner they begin baking,
the longer the finalists will have

to cool their carrot cakes
before decorating.

[Crystelle] Because I've got four layers,

I want to make sure
that each layer is the same.

[Matt] Whilst Crystelle and Chigs
are hoping to speed up the cooling process

by baking individual sponges,

with his final Signature,
Giuseppe is taking a huge gamble.

He plans to bake one large cake
and then slice it into three layers.

[Giuseppe] I'm using
a heating rod in the centre

and a cake belt around it,
to homogenise the heat across the cake.

These are going to go in now.

-I'll do 23 minutes first.
-[timer beeping]

I'll check it at 30 minutes.
It might need an extra 10 minutes after.

[timer beeping]

[Crystelle laughing]

I'm there. Done.

One hour and 15 minutes.

-A long time.
-[indistinct chatter]

Bakers, this is the last time
we will be telling you

that you are halfway through
a Signature Challenge.

[Noel] A classic carrot cake

is decorated and filled
with a simple cream cheese icing.

[Chigs] I want to try
something new with it.

[Noel] But for the final Signature bake,

that won't be enough for Paul and Prue.

This is the pineapple jam.

For me,
pineapple is one of the best fruits ever,

and I think it might complement the cake.

Hello. Congratulations.

-Thank you.
-You're in the final.

-I can't believe it.
-Wow.

I mean, this time last year,
you hadn't even started baking, had you?

Ermâ¦ No, no, yeah, I was baking last year.

-This time last year.
-Oh. Mmm.

The year before that I wasn't.

That's not that good then,
is it, for the show.

Bit disappointing.

[man] Hi, Chigs.

Congratulations on making it to the final.

What you've achieved in one
and a half years of baking is amazing.

[Matt] Bubbled away in the tent,
none of this year's finalists

have seen their family and friends
for almost two months.

I'm so proud of you.

And your dad would be proud of you too.

All the best for next two days.

I love you so much.

[Chigs] I lost my father when I was young.

I think I was 12 years old.
He died really young.

So I just take every opportunity I can.

I'm not gonna wait
for things to happen, I just do it.

That's the reason
why I wanted to come here.

Because I know
I'm gonna make amazing memories.

-[woman] Say, "Good luck on Bake Off."
-Good luck on Bake Off.

[Chigs] Getting
into the final's a big thing.

Getting onto this show was massive,
let alone the finals.

-[kisses]
-[Chigs chuckles]

So you've been baking
for not even 18 months?

-Yeah, that's right.
-I would expect you to be here, then.

[laughing] It's easy, isn't it?

-In many ways you've under-achieved.
-Exactly.

-I'm not talking to you.
-Clearly. [laughs]

[Noel] Whilst Chigs attempts to add
pineapple to his first-ever carrot cakeâ¦

This is going to take me forever.

â¦Giuseppe
has a filling that goes back generations.

Figs are very common
in the hottest part of Italy.

So, it's the family jam.

Baking is in the family DNA.

'Cause that's a main discussion
at our family gatherings.

What's going to be for dessert?
Who's done it and how?

[Noel] Whilst Giuseppe was growing up
on the west coast of central Italy,

the person who could always answer
those questions was his dad, Cosimo.

[Giuseppe] He was a baker by passion.

Every Sunday he'd put the dessert
in front of us after our main meal,

and I really wanted that
to be the case for my kids.

It was so pleasurable for me,

that I couldn't just
let the tradition die.

-[woman] Here we go.
-[gasps] Oh, no.

Giuseppeâ¦

[speaking Italian] I wish you luck.

[speaking Italian] Infinite.

You're going to make me cry, now.

[speaking Italian]
Because you are better than me.

[speaking Italian] By far.

[speaking Italian] I send you a big hug.
A huge one.

[clears throat]

I'm surprised
that my dad managed to do that.

Yeahâ¦ [clears throat]

He's not very well.

He's getting towards his elderly stage.

[chuckles] He said that I've become
better than he ever was as a baker.

Which is absolutely a lie.

I've got some pictures of the things
that he used to make when he used to work.

And they would make
very good Showstoppersâ¦

[chuckling] for The Bake-Off.

[inhales]

My great aunt makes this every year,
and it's a figs and walnut jam.

And it goes very,
very well with carrot flavour.

Funnily enough,
there isn't any family recipe.

There's no godmother or auntie
that has a carrot cake recipe.

So, I've just gone
for full-on orange curd.

At home, I've got my mum, my dad,
my two sisters and my auntie.

I wouldn't have had the confidence
to apply if it wasn't for them.

I've had a few turning points in my life.

One when I was at school,
teachers called me the class clown.

They hated me.
I was just an absolute terror.

My parents sat me down and said,
"You need to sort your life out."

"We're not going to spoon-feed you.
You need to work hard."

And I thought, "Okay."
That was one turning point.

The second one is definitely this.

[all] Hi, Crystelle!

How on Earth
have you made it to the final?

[Matt] It was Crystelle's parents,

along with her sisters
Corelle and Chanelle,

that convinced her to apply
for the Baking Show.

I was adamant.
I said, "No way I'm going to get on."

And they said, "No, you better do it
because you never know what will happen."

And you know, Crystelle,

Granddad will be
looking down on you from up above

with the biggest smile on his face.

No matter what happens,

you have made us
the proudest family in the world.

[all] We love you, Crystelle!

[all cheering]

They think I can do it. [laughs]

-[man] Can you do it?
-I don't know.

But I'll try my best. [chuckles]

Yeah.

[Matt] The longer
the sponges stay in the oven,

the less time they'll have to coolâ¦

[Chigs] Oh, no. Just ain't happy.

â¦forcing the bakers
to decorate a warm cake.

I think they look all right.

[Matt] And the first bake
in the final will end in disaster.

I've got 30 minutes for the cake,
and then I have to bake the walnuts.

So I'm, literally,
to the very last second.

Then they have to go
on for decoration. Cold.

Bakers, you have half an hour left.

Half an hour.

Let these cool. Chill, chill, chill!

[timer beeping]

[Giuseppe] I've started
making the frosting now.

[Noel] I'm going to say this,
and I'm going to get letters.

Basically, carrot cake is for people
who think they're being healthy.

And they go, "I don't eat cake,

apart from carrot cake,
which is really healthy."

And you go, "I don't think
it's that healthy."

There is a quarter
of a litre of oil in mine.

So, that's notâ¦ Look at this.

Where you've gone wrong,
when you're trying to be healthy, is cake.

[Crystelle] I'm just gonna start
on my pistachio mascarpone frosting.

[Chigs] I'll start making the frosting.

Frosting is ready. Jam is ready.
They have to be baked.

Just cake now. Two minutes.

[Crystelle] I can start assembling,
which is stressful stuff.

Quite nice and firm, which is good.

Let's get this jam on here.

It's done.

And I can go straight in with those.

[Crystelle] Four layers,

but more layers
means I can put more filling in

and pack as much flavour as possible.

[Giuseppe] Now, it's all about
getting stuff as cool as possible

so that it doesn't collapse.

You have 15 minutes left.

Do you think
Giuseppe's got enough time, there?

It's still very hot. I've got no options.

I'm gonna have to slice it.
This is not gonna be pretty.

[Noel] The judges have demanded
exquisite decorationâ¦

My hand is shaking.

â¦worthy of a baking show finalâ¦

I'm going to stick in a dowel,
just to stop it sliding around too much.

[Matt] You've got a baby carrot
and made smaller carrots.

[Chigs] Yes.

And then you're going to make
smaller carrots out of those?

-I might quarter them.
-And then even smaller?

-[Chigs] Can do.
-[Matt] Don't go too small.

They'll be invisible to the naked eye.

-They'll lose their impact.
-We'll know they're there.

-We'll know they're there.
-It's literally steaming.

This is going to be carnage.
If it breaks, it breaks.

I don'tâ¦ I can'tâ¦

This is what The Bake-Off
is about, isn't it?

[Crystelle] There is a slight lean.

I'll put in a few dowels to make sure
that this stays where it needs to be.

It's really crumbly.
This is going to fall to pieces.

[Crystelle] Stay calm. Stay calm.

-How long do we have?
-[Noel] Five minutes remaining.

It's breaking up in front of my eyes.

Better have enough buttercream.

[Giuseppe] This is going to be messy.

[Crystelle] It's leaning, and I'm sure
that's not gonna do me favours.

-How long have we got?
-[Matt] One minute left.

-[Crystelle] It's just okay.
-[Giuseppe] These are still very warm.

No!

[Crystelle sighs]

[Giuseppe] That's enough.

It's horrible because it's melting,
but I will be able to finish it.

Time is up.

[Giuseppe] It's finished.

[Crystelle] It's so wonky, but still.

[Giuseppe] Mine looks
like my face over the years.

It's melting down. Ooh.

-[chuckles]
-Well done, my friend.

[sighs]

[Matt] It's judgement time
in the final Signature Challenge.

-Hello, Crystelle.
-Hello.

-I wouldn't have made it this high.
-Yeah.

By stacking it, you're retaining the heat.

And then you're going
to get some movement.

And it doesn't say to me, "carrot cake,"

but it might when it's opened up.

There are a couple of dowels in there,
just to try and hold it together.

Mmm. I love the flavour.

[Paul] You've got cardamom,
pistachio and then orange.

-Together, it's a really nice flavour.
-You taste all of them.

Yes, and it's well balanced.

But it's not
the best-looking thing you've done.

[sighs]

I particularly like your baby carrots.

[Paul] I think it looks very nice.
I love the pipe work.

-A bit solid.
-[Chigs] Yeah.

[Prue] You had a lot of carrot

and the carrot releases water
once it's in the batter.

I think the pineapple works well.
That bit of sweetness comes through it.

You expect a little bit of stodge
with a carrot cake.

-But this is a little bit rubbery.
-Okay.

You were affected by heat.
It wasn't cold when you put it together

and therefore
you've got a bit of movement.

-But it's fairly level.
-[Prue] Yeah, I like the look of it.

It's three layers of sponge
with figs and walnut jam in between.

It has an absolutely delicious flavour,
but the texture is very soft.

[Paul] Because the cake was warm
when you did it,

that's what's causing you to think,
"Is it underbaked, stodgy?" It's not.

It's just you've got the cream cheese
and you've got the jam

and it's soaking into a warm cake.

-So that'sâ¦
-It's added moisture.

[Paul] Yes, it has.

But I think the flavours are delicious.
The idea of introducing figs was good.

And it still tastes like carrot cake.
Which is important.

-[Paul] Thank you.
-Thank you.

Well done.

[Giuseppe] The look of the cake
wasn't particularly stunning,

but I'm glad
they managed to see through that.

The fact that I made my least
nice-looking cake on the final

is probably not the most fortunate thing.

[Chigs] The thing is, nobody smashed it.

Everybody got some feedback, soâ¦

It's not a tragedy. It's not finished.

[Noel] The bakers must now face
their final gingham-wrapped mystery.

Well, bakers, I know
you must be devastated

that this is your last
Technical Challenge.

Crystelle, my thoughts are with you.

-[Crystelle and Matt laugh]
-Shedding tears.

Now, this challenge
has been set by Paul Hollywood.

Paul, any pearls of wisdom to impart?

You'll have to use
your baking knowledge on this one

because we've taken out
most of the method.

[chuckling]

[Matt] As ever, this task is judged blind.

So we ask Paul and Dame Prue
to leave us alone.

[Noel] For your Technical Challenge,

Paul would love you
to make 12 Belgian buns.

Your Belgian buns must be
filled with sultanas and lemon curd.

[Matt] You have two and a half hours.

-On your marks.
-Get set.

[sing-song] Bake!

-Is that it?
-Are you taking the mick?

[laughing]

-[Matt] What are you laughing at?
-There's two instructions.

-Oh, my God. That's it?
-Yeah!

"Make Belgian buns.
Fill it with lemon curd and sultanas."

That's cracking.

I've done a cinnamon bun so I feel
like that's enough bun knowledge.

Maybe today's the day
that I do well on a Technical.

I've never seen a Belgian bun.
I have no idea what they look like.

Paul, for our final Technical Challenge,
we've got Belgian buns.

You haven't taken all the method out,
have you?

-Yeah.
-[laughing] Paul,

I think that's unbelievably unkind.

[Paul] You can see
where it's been coiled around.

-[Prue] Yeah.
-[Paul] You should get that lemon,

and a bit of sweetness
coming from the icing.

It's just got that bit of chewiness,
which I like.

I don't think there'll be any trouble
with them making the dough.

And of course they know
how to make lemon curd.

It's what to do with them
when they've got them.

I mean, how did they know
what a Belgian bun looks like?

We've got three great bakers in there.
Someone will get it right.

It's an enriched dough.
I've done enriched dough in the past.

This will be a very sticky dough.
It's gonna be very difficult to handle.

[Crystelle] You need
to work the hell out of it

to work up all that gluten.

My dad used to do this very often
when we made pizza dough.

"Refine the dough," he said.
I don't know what that means.

At last, I'm as tall as Giuseppe.

-That's not something to be proud of.
-Hello.

There's no more Italian thing
you could be doing right now than this.

If there was an advert made for Giuseppe,

-this is what you'd be doing isn't it?
-There you go.

It will go, [dramatically] "Giuseppe,
coming to a cinema near you from Italy."

-Giuseppe.
-That sounds like a very American accent.

"He likes limoncello and cappuccino

-and arms as long as other people's legs."
-[laughing]

"He wore gloves
where his shoes should be."

-"He was Giuseppe." [laughs]
-If I ever make it to Hollywood,

I'll give you a shout.

[Chigs] Dough done.

So I'm now gonna prove this
for an hour minimum.

[Matt] Paul's demanded
a creamy lemon curd fillingâ¦

I made an orange curd this morning.

â¦with no explanation as to how to make it.

-Have you seen that? Paul Vaguey-wood.
-Really helpful.

I have never made curd. Ever.

That's gonna be a wild guess.

Lemon curd looks very much like a custard.

So it needs to be
like a creamy liquidy thingy.

[Crystelle] Okay,
curd has gone in the freezer,

-just to chill.
-[Chigs] Mmm.

[Giuseppe] Does this look like
a curd to you?

I'm saying nothing. "Belgian Buns."

-Do you know what they look like?
-Do you not know?

Some sort of cinnamon bun swirled up.

Have you been to Belgium?

I've been to Belgium a few times.

-Yes.
-Have you? Why?

Bakers, you are halfway through.

It looks like it's twice the size.

[Crystelle] I think that's fine.

[Giuseppe] The question is,
how do we shape this?

I don't know what to do now.

Just don't know what that man wants.

There is no point in going back
to the instructions,

because they say, "Make the Belgian buns."

[sighs] God, it's really hard.
[laughing] God, I hate this.

[Giuseppe] Matt's mentioned
a swirl somewhere.

So they might be like cinnamon buns.

Roll it out, spread the curdâ¦

Sprinkle the sultanas?

I'll roll this out flat,
spread over the curd,

sprinkle all the sultanas,
roll it up like a little sausage.

[Chigs grumbles]

Split the dough into two
and get a rough rectangle shape.

[Crystelle] I want them to get
an even, thick layer of curd.

This is going to all be very tight.

[Giuseppe] It is very tricky because
they did say, "Perfect swirl."

[Crystelle] The longer your dough,
the more of a swirl you'll get,

because you can really roll it up.

[Chigs] Let's see what happens.

[Giuseppe] I can only hope
that this is right.

Each roll needs to be the same.
I'm sure they'll want uniformity.

[Crystelle] How thick should each bun be?

If the buns have to be like cinnamon buns,

they would have to be
a couple centimetres each.

[Crystelle] If I do 1.2.

[Chigs] Five.

It needs to be a significant swirl.

I think whenever they ask for a swirl,
it has to be visible.

[Chigs] Mine look too high.

I rolled it the wrong way.
I rolled it long way upwards.

Whereas those guys have done
the short side and gone that way.

[Crystelle] And we have lift-off.

Can't do anything now.

Bakers, you have half an hour left.

Sorry. I was
just on the ceiling, eating bugs.

Okay.

[Chigs] I'm just going in at 180.

'Cause that's the bit of information
they did give us.

[Giuseppe] I'll go for 20 minutes first.

Fingers and toes crossed,
say a little prayer and hope for the best.

Coffee time.

You have 15 minutes left.

[Crystelle] They look a little bit pale.
Hmm.

[Giuseppe] They're browning.
It's looking good so far.

[Crystelle] I think
they should be golden brown.

I don't know, is the honest answer.

I'll keep them in there
until they are an even brown colour.

[Chigs] The swirl's
the only thing I'm worried about.

There's only three of us now.
I could be in last position.

-[whistles]
-You watching your bake?

-It's a very good perspective.
-Happy?

Yeah. Unless I've burnt them.
What should I do? What should I do?

Just chill out.
Don't worry about it. It's only the final.

[Crystelle] I might be
cutting it a bit fine.

I might have to cut this down
by about two to four minutes.

By doing that,
it should give me enough time

for my buns to cool before I glaze them.
Before I ice them.

Don't, Matt, come on.

-I'm better than that.
-You're better than that. Don't you dare!

The tension is palpable.

[Noel] Bakers,
you have ten minutes remaining.

Thermometer says they're baked.

[Chigs] They look like baked.
They just look very small.

They look ready.

The worst thing that can happen
is that they are underbaked.

[sighs]

So I'll keep them
another couple of minutes.

[Crystelle] They need to cool
because I need to put icing on them.

Just stick them in the freezer.
Do not drop. [gasps]

[Chigs] This one's got "last"
written all over it.

-[Chigs sighs]
-[timer beeping]

-Yeah.
-[oven beeping]

[Giuseppe] They're definitely done.

His look burnt.

Is this what Belgian buns
should look like?

Bakers, you have five minutes left.

[Crystelle] Taking them out now.

-[Chigs] I'll put icing on it.
-[Crystelle] I can do this. I can do this.

[Giuseppe] I hope
I haven't overbaked them.

Some of them are very dark.

[Crystelle] Oh, God.
Why are my hands shaking?

Turned into a shaking puppet.

[Giuseppe] I have to be quick.
Cherry in the middle.

I'm almost there.
There's no time to waste.

Bakers, your time is up.

[Chigs blows raspberry]

Please bring your bakes
and place them behind your photo.

[Matt] Paul and Prue are expecting
perfectly swirled, golden Belgian buns

filled with silky lemon curd

and topped with icing and glace cherries.

[Paul] Right. Now, these aren't too bad.

They're a little uneven.
The icing is a bit erratic.

-[Paul] But the colour's pretty uniform.
-[Prue] Yeah.

Mmm. Good lemon curd.

-It tastes all right.
-I think that's very nice.

[sighs in relief]

[Paul] Let's move on to number two.
They're too small, too high.

Cooked too thick.
Let's have a look inside.

-They're a bit too chewy and too solid.
-The dough may have been too thick.

-So, instead of rolling out thinâ¦
-I think it needed to be bigger.

Yeah. And have several spirals.

Moving on to number three.

-These are overbaked. Massively.
-[Prue] Overbaked.

They're very technically neatly done.

The icing's perfect, the shape is lovely.

Everything except
leaving them in the oven too long.

Oh. That's such a pity,
because this is the final.

-Dry as a bone.
-Hmm.

[Prue] Overbaked.

[Noel] Paul and Prue will now rank
the final Technical Challenge.

[Paul] Okay, in last place,
we have this one.

Giuseppe. Massively overbaked.

They would have been number one,
bar for the colour.

So, in second place
we have this one. Who's that?

Chigs.

That's what you should
have been rolling up

and what you were rolling up is thatâ¦

-Which meansâ¦
-[laughing] Oh, my God.

In first place we have this one.
Crystelle, the colour's good.

The roll is good. Well done.

[Crystelle laughs]

I cannot believe I've come first
in a Technical Challenge in the final.

Took me ten weeks, but I got there.

[Giuseppe] It's very disappointing.

Overbaking is something that,
at this stage, I should know better.

[Chigs] I'm second,
by the skin of my teeth.

[chuckling] I just need to have
an amazing day tomorrow.

I've done it before.
Can I do it again on the final? [chuckles]

Not asking for much, am I?

I don't make things easy for myself.
That's my problem.

[thunder rumbling]

[Matt] There's just
one challenge remaining

in The Great British Baking Show of 2021.

[Giuseppe] Ooh.

[Crystelle] It's the last time
we'll be doing thisâ¦

[Chigs giggling]

â¦walking into this tent. [sighs]

[Prue] We always say this.
It all depends on the Showstopper.

-[Noel laughs]
-This time it really does, doesn't it?

I would say that Crystelle
was slightly ahead of Giuseppe,

who's slightly ahead of Chigs.

Giuseppe in the Technical,
what was he doing?

He said he was watching them all the time.

-He couldn't have been.
-I might've distracted him a little bit.

-So, it's your fault?
-Probably. [laughs]

What has been so amazing
is the progression Crystelle has made.

But Chigs has been
so good of late, you know.

If he has a banger,
he could be up for a shout.

I think today's gonna be a real marathon.

Yeah, it's called Snickers now.

-Oh, is it? Sorry.
-[Noel laughs]

[all laugh]

Bakers, it's time for your
final Showstopper Challenge.

Paul and Prue would like you
to create an outstanding

Mad Hatter's tea party display

worthy of your final challenge
in the tent.

[Noel] The judges are looking
for a magical display

of sweet and savoury afternoon tea treats

shaped and decorated
in a Mad Hatter kind of a way.

Your display should showcase

at least four
different baking disciplines.

You have four and a half hours.

-On your marks.
-[sing-song] Get set.

[in Cockney accent] It all comes down
to the Showstopper.

[normal voice] Bake.

[whispers] Breathe.

Just remember to breathe.

There's a load to do.
Everyone's going on a mad one today.

[Giuseppe] There's so much to do.

This theme is the Mad Hatter's tea party.

So, we should have a feeling
that this is Alice in Wonderland.

It's all an illusion.
We want some of that craziness.

We want
at least four disciplines of baking.

A little bit of sweet, a bit of savoury
to find that balance.

There's an element of juggling.
You want that oven full.

So, one straight after the other.

If you've got an empty oven,
for me, something's wrong.

Get everything baked
as quickly as possible,

then you can cool and decorate.

[Prue] I want to see perfect bakes.

Amazing decoration.

And a whole display
that transports us into Wonderland.

-[Paul] Hi, Chigs.
-Morning!

Mad Hatter's tea party,.
What are you doing?

[Chigs] My centrepiece is going to be
a cake flavoured with orange curd

and it'll look like the Cheshire cat.

Second thing I'm doing
are jammy biscuit playing cards,

but the jam's gonna be flavoured

with strawberry,
elderflower and black pepper.

Interesting.

[Noel] The Cheshire cat
and playing card biscuits

will be joined by
chicken and mushroom pocket watch pies

and toadstools made from coloured brioche

filled with a lemon and lime
crÃ¨me patisserie.

[Paul] Have you done a timing sheet
to get it all done?

I've done a list of everything
in the order I need to do it.

We've given you a fair amount of time,
but you've got to rise brioche.

[chuckling] Fair amount of time, Paul?

-Good luck.
-Thank you very much.

[Matt] Whilst Chigs races to prepare
the dough for mini brioche toadstoolsâ¦

I just hope I'm able to finish off
everything I've got in my head.

â¦Giuseppe's hoping to grow something
much bigger.

My dough will be filled
with chocolate and hazelnut filling,

shaped in the form of a mushroom.

[Matt] A giant tear-and-share
brioche mushroom

will tower over mango and passion fruit
"drink me" panna cottas,

orange and fig heart-shaped muffins,

and an asparagus and pea-filled
choux caterpillar.

-Hopefully, I won't burn anything.
-This is your challenge, surely.

-Do you think?
-[Noel] Yeah.

I'd say you've got four baking skills,
whereas the other two, not sure.

-[both laughing]
-Maybe two and a half.

[Noel] As dough needs time to prove,

all of the finalists
have begun with their bread.

It's very wet dough.
I always like to finish it by hand.

[Noel] Leave it any later and it
won't have long enough to rise.

Dough is gonna have to go in
to first proof, for about half an hour.

[Noel] But Crystelle has taken
this time pressure

to the heart of her Showstopper.

My main centrepiece
is going to be a focaccia.

Erm, which will be a clock.

And that's got za'atar and garlic in it.

[Noel] Crystelle's focaccia clock

will be surrounded by chick pea,
curry-filled Mad Hatter's pies,

cardamom and pistachio toadstool biscuits
and chai cake talking sunflowers.

You're carrying quite a load
with your tea party.

Yes, I am.

It's going to incorporate
all my favourite flavours,

things that I enjoy making.

Everything combined into one.

-Good luck.
-Thank you.

Self-raising flour.

[Matt] With dough in the proving drawer,

the finalists need to get their
first of four bakes into the oven.

Cake, cake, cake.

[Matt] Any delay in these early stagesâ¦

Two tea bags.

â¦will mean less time to cool and decorate

the most important bake
in the competition.

[Giuseppe] I don't usually like muffins,

but these with figs
and oranges are just delicious.

The talking flowers are one of
the coolest things in Wonderland.

So I am doing chai-flavoured sponge

and I'm going to cut these
into little circles,

and turn them into talking flowers.

[Noel] Whilst Crystelle and Giuseppe
have planned small individual cakesâ¦

[mumbles indistinctly]

â¦Chigs' sponges will be transformed
into one of the tale's biggest characters.

I'm doing a centrepiece cake
that'll look like the Cheshire cat

but in the colours of
Leicester City football club.

[chuckles]

-Wow.
-I don't even support Leicester city.

-Don't you?
-No, but I'm going to do it for my city.

Don't say that on television,
you're from Leicester.

-I know.
-Who do you support?

-I can't say that on TV.
-[both laugh]

[Crystelle] Be good to me, please.

[Matt] The moment the first bake
hits the ovenâ¦

-[timer beeping]
-[sighs]

â¦preparation for the next one
has to begin.

New challenge: speed baking. [chuckles]

I can do this. I can do this.

Now putting my muffins in the oven.

[gasps] And the oven is off.

The door wasn't closed properly.

[Matt] Giuseppe's oven is cold.

Switched off.

Jesus. Yeah.

[Matt] It's a setback
that could lose him priceless minutes.

I really don't need this.

Bakers, you have three hours remaining.

Come on!

[Noel] Whilst Giuseppe waitsâ¦

[speaking Italian] How do I reach 350?

â¦Crystelle and Chigs
have moved on to their savoury treats.

[Chigs] I am making sweet leek
and chicken and mushroom pies.

The tops of the pies
are gonna look like clocks.

-[Noel] Are you doing little curry pies?
-[Crystelle] I am.

-They're going to be top hats
-Top hats.

with little bunny ears
coming out of them.

[Noel] As well as being
behind on his baking,

Giuseppe is the only finalist

that needs to find time
to set a tea party treat.

Panna cotta in Italian means
cooked cream, and that's what it is.

The idea is that Alice
should be drinking this.

I will have "drink me" bottles.

Half of it is going to be flavoured
with mango,

the other half
with vanilla.

I should be shaping the dough now.

I want to finish the panna cotta first.

This little guy has literally
just been proving in olive oil,

and I've got my infused olive oil
with za'atar and garlic.

[Giuseppe] It's done.

[Chigs] This will make
the base of the mushroom.

I'm just going to
push this into the corners.

Very oily.

I'm going to let this prove
for another whole hour.

[Chigs] This is all thanks to Jurgen.

-[Matt] Oh, really?
-Jurgen taught me how to do this.

That's the base of the mushroom.
That'll be filled with crÃ¨me pat.

-Matt?
-CrÃ¨me Matt. [chuckling]

Perfect!

These go in to set.

And finally start making the bread.

Okay.

-[timer beeping]
-Oh, that's my cake.

[Matt] One bake downâ¦

Before I forget, let me whack up my oven.

â¦three to go.

-I've got loads, Noel.
-Have you given yourself a crazy--

A crazy amount of cakes, biscuits, pies.

-It's the final. You gotta go for it.
-You've got to.

-Pastry going all over me.
-You're on wheels.

If anyone can pull this off, it's you.

[Giuseppe] I'm going to be shaping this
into a mushroom.

I'm not gonna have time
to bake everything.

Pie base. We're gonna go in now.

I'm just going to knead in
that green food colouring.

Tops of the pies.

The head on the mushroom
is going to be layered.

So I'm going to be making discs,
layer them with chocolate and hazelnuts,

and then prove them again.

Biscuit, biscuit, biscuit, biscuit.
We're on track, we're on track.

Might just step it up a gear
after I've done this.

Did you sleep last night?

I actually did,
although I had a recurring dream

that I forgot to prove my focaccia.

And I kept waking up, like,
"Why did I not put my timer on?"

[Matt] And what was the consequence of it?

I don't know what happened.
It was one of those cliff-hanger dreams.

[Noel] Whilst Crystelle is still haunted
by a focaccia clockâ¦

[Giuseppe] I'm takin' them out.

â¦time is still proving a nightmare
for Giuseppe.

'Seps, I heard you forgot
to turn your oven on.

-I didn't forget to turn my oven on.
-What happened?

[stumbling] The door wasn't fully closed.

-All right.
-The oven didn't shut--

Let me tell you a few things
about baking, all right?

You need heat.

-[both chuckling]
-Mainly from an oven.

They're done.

Am I late for a very important date?
I'm not sure.

[Chigs] Brioche has gone
into the oven now.

Biscuits are going in after the bread.

Good luck, hats. Please be good to me.

[Giuseppe] Now we're starting
some choux buns

and shaping them as a caterpillar.

How long have we got?

Bakers, you have one hour left.

Hi! I'm here with Mervis the Alien.

-Er, Mervis, ermâ¦
-[makes indistinct noises]

Who do you think is going to win?

[gibbering]

[chuckling]

[squeals]

That's interesting.
I thought Jairzeno left in week two.

-Hmm.
-Ah!

[Giuseppe] The batter is slightly too wet.

[Chigs] There's the brioche.

[Crystelle] This is gonna go in the oven
very shortly.

I only learned this from bread week
that it's supposed to be so oily.

So I thought the more oil, the better.

[Chigs] I'm gonna put the biscuits in now.

[Giuseppe] These are going in.

[Matt] As well as attempting to stick to
an incredibly tight baking scheduleâ¦

This little piggy
is going in for 15 minutes.

â¦the finalists have multiple fillings
to squeeze in.

[Chigs] Right. CrÃ¨me pat.
Lemon and lime flavour.

This is going into the brioches.

[Giuseppe] I'm preparing the filling
for the choux buns.

The flavours will be asparagus and peas.

The peas are there just to give
some sweetness and creaminess.

I should add panna cotta layer.

Before that, I shouldâ¦

-Got a proposition for you.
-Oh, no!

This is Mr. Spatula.

Look, he's crying
because he knows the result.

-[Crystelle] Stop it.
-But he can also change the result.

Don't tell me I've got to
kiss that spatula. I'm not doing it.

-[laughing]
-I'm not doing it.

I knew you were gonna ask me to do it
and I'm not.

-He's crying.
-Can I give him an elbow pump?

You wanna, what,
just smash him in the throat?

So, hats.

[Noel] This is Mr. Spatula
and he knows the winner.

He also has the power to
change the result.

-All you need to do is kiss there--
-No.

-Like you'd kiss the Pope's hand.
-No.

This should be my focaccia.

I might just prove it.

It's really hard 'cause
there's piping hot oil in there.

Oh, that definitely seems done.

Yeah, I might take it out.

This is Mr. Spatula. You just have to
kiss his head and then you win.

She wouldn't do it and he wouldn't do it.

Yes!

The majority of it's all done.

I have to bake my biscuits,
then it's a case of decorating everything.

I'm going to start doing that now.

Yeah. Yeah.

[muttering]

[Matt] Bakers! You have half an hour left!

[Giuseppe] I might have to miss out
on some of the elements.

They need to go now.

Gotta get that cake done.

And these guys
are gonna bake for 12 minutes.

[Matt] Crystelle and Chigs may be ready to
begin assembling and decorating,

but Giuseppe,
despite running behind schedule,

has given himself yet
another element to make.

Ginger snaps.
These will go on the panna cotta.

I've gotta fill my piping bags
and then I'm gonna start piping!

[Chigs] There's two blues.
There'll be stripes.

'Cause the Cheshire Cat's stripy,
isn't she? Or he? Or whatever it is.

[Crystelle] These are going to become
little sandwich cakes.

What I can do now is to fill theseâ¦

[Crystelle] Smooth down these sides.

[Giuseppe] The outside
I'm making in purple.

It needs to be psychedelic and mad.

[Crystelle] This will be a sunflower.

[Giuseppe] Come on.

That's the cat done.
How long do we have left?

Fifteen minutes left.

That'll give me enough time
to put everything on the board.

I'm not gonna get
to do all of my extra bits.

I think they look all right.

Eleven minutes.

[Crystelle] All that's left
is to pipe little faces.

[Chigs] This is not a Sharpie, by the way.

Edible pen.

[oven beeping]

[Crystelle] So nice
seeing it come together.

[Giuseppe] Can't believe I'm done.

I have to assemble things,
but I don't have to make anything else.

[Noel] But Giuseppe's assembly
isn't straightforward.

You only have five minutes left.

[Chigs] This mushroom's done.

The head.

I'm sweating.

[Giuseppe] They're very well done.

-Done.
-One minute left.

What am I missing?
Oh, yes, the caterpillar.

Oh! God, they're all falling.

My hearts are falling.

Representing my love life.

[Noel] Your time is up!

[all applauding]

[squeals cheerfully]

Oh! Oh, my gosh!
You're gonna break your back.

Oh, my God!

Well done!

Completed it, mate.

-[applause continues]
-[Giuseppe whistles]

[Matt] It's judgement time
for this year's final Showstoppers.

Giuseppe. Would you like to bring out
your Showstopper?

Oh, God.

It's very precarious.

[Prue chuckles]

Well done.

I think it's simple and effective.

These are all very small.
I expected them to be a little bit bigger.

Okay.

[Prue] I don't mind
because it's a caterpillar.

The caterpillar is choux buns

with asparagus, peas filling
and mascarpone topping.

Mmm. Delicious.
You certainly get the asparagus. And pea.

Because it's been filled
with this creamy mixture,

they're quite soft now.

Which is a pity,
because it's all the same texture.

-Mmm.
-[Paul] Let's look at the sweet bread.

[Giuseppe] So the centrepiece is filled
with chocolate and hazelnut.

[Prue] Goodness!
That is quite complicated.

Hmm.

-It's very Italian in its flavour.
-[Prue] Isn't it?

[Paul] I like it, the bread is so crispy.

This is lovely.

-[Paul] This is theâ¦
-[Giuseppe] Orange and figs.

-[Paul] Orange and fig.
-[Prue] They're very cute.

They're very soft, they're juicy,
and they have a lovely flavour to 'em.

-[Prue] They're very good.
-You can take one of these, Prue.

[Giuseppe] They're passion fruit,
mango, panna cotta

with brandy snaps.

[crunching]

The panna cotta is delicious.

[chuckles] I mean, it really is stunning.

[Prue] That is the most perfect texture
for a panna cotta.

Just set and it sort of cracks
as you touch it.

-I might finish this one.
-[Prue] Mmm.

-I'm taking it away with me.
-Yeah, you did well. Thanks very much.

[all laughing]

[Paul] I like the choux buns.

Love the heart cakes.

-And the panna cotta is bliss.
-Thank you very much.

-Thank you.
-[Matt] Well done.

-[sighs]
-[sighs]

[sighs]

Chigs, would you like to bring
your final Showstopper up here?

Please may I have a hand
carrying it to the front, Matt?

-[Matt] Massive.
-[Chigs] Sorry.

To me.

-To you.
-To me.

-To you.
-[chuckling] To me.

To you.

-[Matt] Okay.
-[Paul] Thank you.

[inhales deeply]

I'm quite impressed
with the overall look of them.

I think you've got the Mad Hatter's
tea party very well.

I think the colour of the catâ¦
I love the cards.

-These are particularly interesting to me.
-[Prue] There's something mad.

Which is part of
the sort of surreal thing.

[Paul] These clocks look quite neat.

-Shall we start with the savoury first?
-Yeah, why not?

[Chigs] Chicken, sweet leek
and mushroom pies.

-That's delicious.
-[Prue] Mmm.

[Paul chuckling]
One of my favourite things.

Very nice pastry.
Has it got thyme in there?

-Thyme and tarragon.
-[Prue] That was delicious.

This is a brioche?

[Chigs] Yes.
Filled with a lemon and lime crÃ¨me pat.

Delicious crÃ¨me pat.

It's beautiful. It's nice and sweet,
but just the right level of sweetness.

It's nice-looking.

[Chigs] These are shortbread biscuits

with strawberry, elderflower
and black pepper jam.

-[Prue] I think it's beautiful.
-[Paul] It is.

[Prue] The punched-out hearts
are charming.

-Don't really like to spoil it.
-[Noel] Go on, Prue.

-[Prue] Mmm. Very good.
-[Paul] Jam's very good.

Jam is excellent.

[Paul] It's a nice, buttery biscuit.
I'm not getting the elderflower.

-I'm getting strawberry.
-And black pepper?

-No.
-[Chigs] Okay.

[Paul] The biscuit is delicious with it.

-Okay.
-[Prue] Right.

-[Paul] This is orange cake?
-[Chigs] Yeah.

It's got orange curd
and mascarpone cream in the middle.

I was looking forward
to the Cheshire cat's grin.

I know. I'd kind of run out of time.

[exhales heavily]

-[chuckling] That's a delicious sponge.
-It's really good.

The orange really works.

You're left with a beautiful
floral flavour in your mouth.

[Prue] You've not put too much buttercream
round the edge, so it's not too sweet.

That's a very nice cake.

-[Paul] Very good cake.
-Thank you.

-[Paul] Well done.
-You've done a good job.

-Well done, Chigs.
-[Chigs] Thanks.

-[Matt] Amazing.
-Thank you.

[breathing heavily]

[sighs in relief]

[exhales]

Crystelle, would you like to bring out
your Showstopper?

Please may I have a hand?

Threeâ¦ twoâ¦ oneâ¦

-Lift. Yeah.
-[Noel] You got it?

-[Crystelle] Yep.
-I've got puppet legs. Don't drop it.

It's okay.
I'm bending my knees and it's fine.

-Don't let go.
-Where you gonna go?

This way.

[chuckles] Don't go low on me.

Okay, we're gonnaâ¦ Okay.

-Right. Erâ¦
-[Prue] Brilliant.

[Noel whispers] There you go.

[Paul] It looks quite impressive.
It's colourful.

[Prue] I like the little sunflowers
with their faces.

What did you say
these biscuits were called?

They're called nankhatais. They've got
brown butter, cardamom and nuts.

[sighs]

-It's very fudge-like, isn't it?
-Yeah.

It's got a lovely balance of flavours
with the spices in there.

Delicious.

-[Paul] Let's move on to the talking--
-[Prue] Sunflowers.

Which are chai sponges
with cream cheese frosting.

I think that cake is really delicious.
It's very soft.

[Paul] The chai comes through beautifully.

Then the cooling from the cream cheese,
it blends nicely together.

[exhales]

[Paul] This is hot water crust pastry.

[Crystelle] Yeah. Filled with chickpea
and potato curry.

[exhales]

Very nice curry middle.

It's quite solid. But I really like that.

-Absolutely lovely.
-It's a Goan curry? It's delicious.

It's got a lovely kick to it as well.

That's three out of four.

[all chuckle]

-[Paul] Right. Focaccia.
-[Prue] Yeah.

[Crystelle] Which is a za'atar,
garlic and honey focaccia.

[exhales]

Erâ¦

This is not recognizable as focaccia.

-[Crystelle] Oh, no!
-That's raw dough.

[exhales]

-What have you done? That is raw.
-[Crystelle] I don't know.

-Has it been in the oven?
-Yeah.

I don't know what happened.

-That's bizarre.
-[Paul] There's no rise at all.

That's inedible, that one.

-[Prue] That's a pity.
-[Paul] Never seen anything like it.

I'm really sorry. I don't know
what happened. That's bizarre.

But over all, I think your flavours
of what we did try was very good.

Thank you.

-[Prue] Thank you.
-Thank you.

[Crystelle] Obviously,
I focus on the negatives, right?

There was a big fat negative in there.

I'm just baffled.

How the hell did that happen
to my focaccia?

[Giuseppe] I feel confused.

Pretty much everybody
had very good comments,

something that didn't quite meet
the expectations of the judges.

[Chigs] I'd be lying
if I said I wasn't nervous.

I've been waiting
all this time now. Ten weeks.

[chuckling] I want to know the result now.

[audience cheering]

[Matt] Everyone in our bubble
who has been locked down

and worked so hard to make
the Baking Show happen

has been invited to
the greatest Mad Hatter's tea party

of 2021.

And to witness
who will be crowned champion.

Do you think Crystelle
could still win this?

[Paul] It's got complicated

because she's dropped,
because of the focaccia being raw.

-I could see her heart sink then.
-I know. Poor girl.

[Paul] So Chigs has come from the outside.

You were very impressed with Chigs.

You were pretty impressed with Giuseppe
but when it came to this,

-you couldn't stop eating it.
-That was very good.

We don't want to rush
into picking someone,

so we'll sit down,
have another cup of tea,

maybe a couple of glasses of wine.

See you tomorrow, chaps.

-[chuckling] See you tomorrow.
-We might not be back, is that okay?

That's fine, we'll do it ourselves.

[all cheering]

Well, before we do anything else,

I would like to thank,
on behalf of the show,

everybody who looked after us
here at the hotel.

The cleaners, the caterers
and all of the staff.

Thank you so much.

[all cheering and applauding]

And, now, I would like to invite
our three finalists

to come and join us.

[all cheering]

Giuseppe. Come on.

You guys are amazing.

Bakers, thank you so much
for bringing your warmth

and good humour and, of course,
your brilliant bakes into the tent.

And now, I'm going to hand over
to my colleague, Mr. Noel Fielding,

who has something to tell you.

The winner
of The Great British Baking show isâ¦

Giuseppe.

[all cheering]

[Crystelle yelling] Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

[Noel chuckling]

-[Noel chuckling] Congratulations!
-[Matt] Congratulations, man.

[cheering continues]

[Paul] Well done, Giuseppe.

Thank you. Grazie.

[both laugh]

-[Prue] Well done!
-[voice breaking] Grazie.

[cheers and applause continue]

There are no words.
[chuckling] I'm speechless.

For once.

[Paul] You're the first Italian
to ever win it.

[all laughing]

From the first time
I walked into the tent,

on the first Signature
and I saw his mini rolls, I went,

"That looks like our winner."

You could see the heart and soul
going into his baking.

He's done an incredible job.

He's such a classic, beautiful baker.

He represents a long tradition
of classical Italian baking.

And done it brilliantly
the whole way through.

So I'm going home
to make lots more Italian cakes,

'cause they really are good.

[Chigs grunts] Come on.
Well done, my friend. You deserve it.

[Chigs] I am over the moon
that Giuseppe's won

'cause I know how hard he has worked
throughout this whole competition.

It's a euphoric moment.

It's time to move on
to the next challenge in my life.

Bake Off final. Tick. [chuckles]

Thanks. Sorry about the focaccia.

I am so happy for Giuseppe.

He's an incredibleâ¦ I'm getting emotional.

He's an incredible guy.

So genuine, an insane baker
and he really deserves that win.

His family are gonna be so proud of him.

-[Noel] Let that sink in.
-[Giuseppe] I'm in shock. I'm in shock.

All I can think of is the reaction
I'm gonna get from my mum and dad.

The fact that everything
I've done to deserve this

comes from his heritage.

I think it's going to be the best
thank-you note I could possibly send him.

He's going through
a very hard time, health-wise, soâ¦

Er, I think that this is
going to be a boost.

-[Matt] Go take a bow.
-[woman] Go on!

[all cheering]

[Giuseppe] I don't say often and lightly
that I'm proud of what I doâ¦

But, in this case,
I can't possibly not say that.

I'm really, really proud that I did this.

[speaking Italian] It's unbelievable,
it's unbelievable.

[all cheering]
