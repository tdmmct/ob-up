<p>In this repository you will find all the files we analyzed in order to produce our findings.</p>
<p>The 'Cleaned Transcripts' main folder contains the final transcripts, as well as a folder with the first version of transcripts and the Python code used to clean them, and PDFs of what was removed by Python. What was removed by hand is in a .txt, and the raw transcripts (V0) are also available there.</p>
<p>'J' in this repo stands for Judging, as in the judging segments; 'NJ' stands for no judging, and is used when a document doesn't contain separated judging segments.</p> 
<p>'GBBO' stands for Great British Bake Off.</p>
<p>Seasons are labelled with 'S' and their number. Episodes are labelled with 'E' and their number.</p>
<p>Some files are presented as .xlsx, and some as .txt due to our needs for analysis, however their content remains the same.</p>
<p>Initial transcripts were collected from subslikescript.com</p>
<p>Cleaning was done on the files in two stages: one with Python (and in one case, Excel) (documentation on how this was done is in the repo at), and one by hand following that cleaning to pick out any remaining odd characters.</p>
